Parliament, Wednesday, 5 December 2018 –  The Portfolio Committee on Rural Development and Land Reform has raised serious concerns with progress regarding the Elandskloof Communal Property Association land claim and the high number of suspensions of officials and managers in the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform. The Committee was today briefed by the Department on its organogram and progress on the Elandskloof Communal Property Association land claim. The committee noted that there was a lack of progress on the Elandskloof land claim with many issues remaining unresolved. The Department informed the committee that a mediator had been appointed. However, the committee raised its dissatisfaction and serious discontent that the same report had previously been submitted. The Department was instructed to submit an updated progress report by end of February 2019. Further, the committee expressed its concern about the high number of acting positions in the Department due to the suspension of officials and management staff members. The Committee is of the view that this impacts negatively on service delivery as officials have to double up in their positions as well as the positions that they are acting in. The Chairperson of the Committee, Ms Phumuzile Ngwenya- Mabila said that there must be a willingness and commitment to ensure that the Department operates effectively and efficiently for the benefit of the people.
