Parliament, Thursday, 13 December 2018 –  The Ad Hoc Committee to identify suitable candidates for the  Filling of Vacancies in the Commission for Gender Equality has placed the curricula vitae  (CVs) of 87 candidates who applied to be considered for membership of the board of the Commission for Gender Equality on the parliamentary website. This decision was taken to foster and enable a culture of openness and public scrutiny when appointing board members. The decision also forms part and promotes Parliament’s strategic imperative to encourage public participation in its work. CVs that have been placed on the parliamentary website will afford civil society an opportunity to scrutinise and send public comment on all candidates that have sent through applications and nominations. Nominations and applications closing date was 10 December 2018. Late applications will not be considered by the committee. The CVs appear below: Arnott, Jayne
