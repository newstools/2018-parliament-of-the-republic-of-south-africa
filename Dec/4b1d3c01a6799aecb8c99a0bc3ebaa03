Parliament, Wednesday, 5 December 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) says the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) should be given a chance to complete the investigation into the Giyani contract that escalated from R100m at inception to R2.4 bn to date. Scopa was looking at the accruals, payables and implementing agents of the Department of Water and Sanitation. It is good that the Chief Executive Officer of Lepelle Northern Water, the implementing agent that is responsible for the controversial Giyani contract, was present today to clarify some things so that it can be clear to everyone that there is a lot of wrong doing that happened in this contract. The directive from the former Minister of Water and Sanitation, Ms Nomvula Mokonyane was given in 2015 and R2.4bn has been spent on this project yet the people of Giyani still do not have water. Everything here is part of the establishment of looting in the department. The committee will continue with the hearing with the department and the Water and Trading Entity on the internal control and leadership in the department tomorrow, 6 December 2018 at Committee Room E249, 2nd Floor, National Assembly Building at 09:30 ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SCOPA, MR THEMBA GODI.
