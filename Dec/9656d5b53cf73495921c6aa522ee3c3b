Parliament, Tuesday, 04 December 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Labour will tomorrow meet with horse-racing and betting operator Phumelela Gaming and Leisure, to discuss working and living conditions of workers in the horse-racing industry, as well as lease agreements with horse trainers. In August this year, the committee conducted oversight visits to the North Rand Training Centre in the Randjesfontein Race Course in Midrand, Gauteng. There the committee witnessed appalling living conditions in the grooms’ hostels, where four or five men shared one small room and cook in gas stoves located outside their rooms. During an interaction with the horse grooms in their hostels, the committee heard about reports of long working hours and failure to comply with the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) legislation, allegedly by horse trainers sub-contracted to Phumelela. The committee was also unimpressed by the absence of women horse grooms in the industry and advised the management of Phumelela to relook into the situation, and ensure gender inclusivity and women’s emancipation.
