Parliament, Thursday, 22 November 2018 – Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Basic Education today condemned the killing of a Grade 1 learner in Makapanstad, North West, allegedly by a Grade 11 learner. Committee Chairperson Ms Nomalungelo Gina said this behaviour is unacceptable. “We cannot but condemn this type of criminality. It has no place in our schools. Schools are supposed to be safe spaces for all our children.” According to media reports, the tragedy occurred on Wednesday morning at the Dikeledi Makapan Primary School. The Grade 11 learner from Mankala Technical High School allegedly hid in the toilets of the primary school. The deceased was one of the first to go to the toilet in the morning and the grade 11 learner allegedly repeatedly stabbed the younger learner, who later died. It appears the suspect knew the deceased, and it is alleged that he was in a romantic relationship with the Grade One learner’s older sister. Ms Gina made a plea for all communities to stand together to work against violence in schools. “Education is a societal issue. We need to reinforce it into our children that violence is not the solution. They cannot solve challenges by becoming violent. A family is now robbed of a young life, who will never realise his life’s promise. “Furthermore, we would like to express our deepest condolences with the family and friends of the deceased. Our thoughts are with you during this difficult time.” ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON BASIC EDUCATION, MS NOMALUNGELO GINA For media enquiries or interviews with the Chairperson, please contact the committee’s Media Officer: Name: Rajaa Azzakani (Ms)
