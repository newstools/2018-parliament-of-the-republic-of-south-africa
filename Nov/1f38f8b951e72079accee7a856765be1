Parliament, Tuesday, 27 November 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) this morning canceled a meeting with the Public Service Commission (PCS), which was set to discuss the PCS’s report on Mr Cox Mokgoro. Scopa was informed yesterday evening by the Chairperson of Committees in the National Assembly that the process Scopa followed in requesting the PSC report on Mr Mokgoro was flawed, illegal and against parliamentary procedures, and should be stopped immediately. The only time that Scopa can request the PSC to investigate any matter is after it has been granted permission through a resolution of the National Assembly. Scopa was also informed that legal advice from the Parliamentary Legal Services, which had been requested by the Office of the Speaker of the National Assembly, agreed with this position. This would have been Scopa’s the third meeting on the issue of Mr Mokgoro. These meetings arise from the Department of Public Works’ and the Property Management Trading Entity’s (PMTE) annual reports, which contained issues of irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure. Scopa will engage with the Office of the House Chairperson of the National Assembly on how to take the issue forward.
