Parliament, Friday, 23 November 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Arts and Culture today concluded its week-long interviews for the Pan South African Language Board (PanSALB). The committee is satisfied with the calibre of candidates it interviewed, and is hopeful that the successful candidates will add value to PanSALB. During the interviews candidates were asked to explain among other things how would they ensure that no one language has hegemony over others and were also asked to comment on the promotion of languages that are marginalised, on ensuring ethical leadership and integrity in the board. As a method of strengthening public participation and transparency, the committee invited the public to attend the interview sessions and to submit their comments.  Comments can still be submitted to Ms Ajabulile Mtiya via email: amtiya@parliament.gov.za or fax: 086 544 0628  by Wednesday, 28 November 2018. Committee Chairperson, Ms Xoliswa Tom highlighted the importance of public participation in these processes, especially when it relates to institutions such as the PanSALB. She also thanked the candidates for availing themselves for the interviews. The committee has scheduled in-depth deliberations on the interviews and public submissions received for next week and there after it will table its recommendations and report to Parliament. The announcement by the Minister of the successful candidates will follow.
