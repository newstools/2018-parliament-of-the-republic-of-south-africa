Parliament, Tuesday, 27 November 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) members reject with contempt the unprecedented and empty threats made by the Deputy Minister of Public Works, Mr Jeremy Cronin, at today’s meeting. Mr Cronin accused Scopa of irregularities and of tarnishing the image of Mr Thulas Nxesi and controversial Department of Public Works employee, Mr Cox Mokgoro. Mr Cronin threatened to take legal action against Scopa for this. Scopa wishes to state that: Scopa will not be threatened or hindered in its work by anyone; Scopa will not relent in its demand for transparency and accountability for public funds; Certain individuals, including Mr Nxesi and Mr Mokgoro, must still account for the apparently irregular appointment of Mr Mokgoro and his company, Honey Cloud at Public Works; and Scopa will seek clarity from the Office of the Speaker of the National Assembly on how the Public Service Commission (PSC) report should be regularised. It is unprecedented that a member of the executive “place on record” a threat to take Parliament to court for doing its work. This unprecedented threat can only be an attempt to cover up for the malfeasance committed. The Department of Public Works remains a department under siege from corrupt employees working in cahoots with external interests. Scopa will relentlessly pursue these crooks.
