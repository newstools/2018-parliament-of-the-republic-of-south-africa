Parliament, Thursday, 08 November 2018 – The Joint Constitutional Review Committee (CRC) today resolved to give members of the committee until Monday to contribute to the recommendations and observations in its draft report on section 25 of the Constitution. Members of the committee have been given until 16h00 on Monday, 12 November 2018, to provide the committee with additional observations and/or recommendations. Co-Chairperson of the committee, Mr Lewis Nzimande, said this request was made last week and, to date, the African National Congress and the Economic Freedom Fighters have provided such material. The committee further resolved to seek permission to have meetings on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday next week. The acting Co-Chairperson of the committee, Mr Stan Maila, reminded members that according to the committee’s agreed-upon programme, the adoption date for its report is next Thursday, 15 November 2018. The CRC was instructed by the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces to ascertain whether a review of section 25 of the Constitution and other clauses is necessary, to make it possible for the state to expropriate land in the public interest without compensation, and also to propose constitutional amendments where necessary. The committee has already held hearings in all nine provinces and several days of oral submissions at Parliament.
