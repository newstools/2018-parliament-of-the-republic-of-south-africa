Parliament, Friday, 23 November 2018 – The Chairperson of Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, Mr Hlomani Chauke, welcomes the appointment of Dr Siyabonga Cwele as the new Minister of Home Affairs. The committee is of the view that the appointment of a new executive authority will bring with it innovations aimed at resolving some of the challenges facing the department.
	
	One of the key challenges for the new Minister will be to resolve the lingering challenge of long queues at service points across the country. In addition, the intermittent challenges with server downtime that hampers the rendering of services must be urgently resolved. Also, the committee has emphasised the need to address the ever-increasing legal liabilities facing the department.
	
	The implementation of measures announced by the President to increase tourism numbers and cut red tape to facilitate investment is paramount.
	
	The committee has committed itself to working with the Minister to find workable solutions to the challenges facing the department.
