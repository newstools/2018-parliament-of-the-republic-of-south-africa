Parliament, Tuesday, 20 November 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) had to cancel today’s meeting with National Treasury, when treasury informed Scopa that it does not have the forensic report on the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS), which was supposed to be presented to Scopa today. Scopa requested National Treasury in June 2018 to present the report, which was to be finalised in July. National Treasury then requested time from Scopa to process the report and Scopa scheduled today’s meeting for the purpose of receiving an update on the forensic IFMS report. It is now concerning that Scopa is informed that there is no report. The Director-General of National Treasury, Mr Dondo Mogajane, informed the committee that challenges of interpretation in the report, compiled by a company called Nexus, is the reason for the delay. Scopa believes that it should have sight of the report, so it can see for itself the issues that the Director-General is concerned about. Scopa resolved that the report must be submitted to the committee, as it is, on Thursday 22 November. A follow-up meeting with National Treasury has been scheduled for discussion of the IFMS report on Wednesday, 05 December 2018.
