Parliament, Thursday, 1 November 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has emphasised the importance of the South African Police Service (Saps) finding ways to deal with the root causes of systemic wrong-doing within the organisation. The committee is of the view that the forensic investigations undertaken by Saps, such as the investigations into the Forensic Data Analysts (FDA) contracts and other companies that are deeply embedded in Saps should address the deeper causes, so that wrongdoing can be eliminated completely from the police. Scopa also wants to stress that it is important to get value for money for forensic reports, such as the one on FDA. It is also important that the employees implicated in wrong-doing in the FDA contracts are not only disciplined, but also that monies lost are recovered from them. The committee is encouraged that 23 Saps employees implicated in the FDA contracts have been referred for disciplinary processes. Scopa will receive a status update on this process next week Wednesday, 07 November 2018. Scopa has resolved to ask the Auditor-General (AG) to look into the five FDA contracts currently under forensic investigation and also provide management letters on the contracts that were sent to Saps. This is so that Scopa can verify whether these contracts were highlighted as irregular expenditure by the AG, with no appropriate action taken by Saps. Scopa is proud that the forensic report on the FDA is as a result of the committee’s probing into these contracts.
