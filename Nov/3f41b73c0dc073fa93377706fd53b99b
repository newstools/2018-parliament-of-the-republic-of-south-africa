Parliament, Wednesday, 21 November 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Telecommunications and Postal Services will in the coming week hold public hearings on the Electronic Communications Amendment Bill [B31-2018], in which role players in the telecommunications sector will be afforded an opportunity to provide oral submissions. MTN, Telkom, Vodacom and the South African Communications Forum are some of the industry bodies that will be making oral presentations. The Bill was tabled before the National Assembly by the Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Mr Siyabonga Cwele, and seeks to amend the Electronic Communications Act of 2005, so as to provide for transformation of the sector through enforcement of broad-based black economic empowerment. It also provides for, among other things, lowering of cost of communications, reduction in infrastructure duplication and encouragement of service-based competition through wireless open access network.
