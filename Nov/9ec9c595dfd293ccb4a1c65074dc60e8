Parliament, Sunday, 11 November 2018 –The Portfolio Committee on Police will on Wednesday hold public hearing on the current rural safety strategy of the South African Police Service. The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Mr Francois Beukman said it was critical to evaluate the current rural safety of the Saps and determine whether more resources should be allocated to priority stations. The implementation of the Saps rural safety strategy at the rural and semi-rural stations will also be evaluated. Communities in rural and deep rural areas should be the eyes and ears of the law enforcement agencies to ensure that violent and contact crime is brought down. Some of the organisations that will be invited to give input to the committee include Afasa, Agri-Sa, Sanco and Cosatu. "The maximum participation of civil society and organised labour is vital to ensure a vibrant and effective rural safety strategy," Mr Beukman said. The involvement and challenges of communities in  CPF's and Safety Forums will also be discussed. Beukman said the Committee will use the 2017/28 crime statistics as guide in evaluating the performance of rural and semi rural stations.
