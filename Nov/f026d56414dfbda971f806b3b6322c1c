Parliament, 14 November 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources has extended condolences to the family and colleagues of the late Mr Shai Mikia Mophapi who was a chief safety officer at the Sibanye-Stillwater mine in Welkom, Free State. Mr Mophapi was shot while seating inside his car at the parking lot of Commando Shopping Centre in Welkom last week Saturday. The committee is concerned about the circumstances around his death, considering that it came at the height of many criminal issues facing the sector, including illegal mining. The committee further noted with dismay the recent criminal activity in the sector, whereby a wife of Harmony Gold executive was kidnapped for two bars of gold as ransom. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, has called on the police to double their efforts in their quest to root out criminality in the sector.
