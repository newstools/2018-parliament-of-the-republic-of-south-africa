Parliament, Wednesday, 28 November 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises has unanimously adopted with amendments the report on an oversight inquiry into allegations of governance failures and state capture at Eskom. The committee was of the view that the process undertaken was an inquisitorial inquiry, not a judicial hearing. The committee did not accuse anyone in the report, but recommended that law-enforcement agencies make further investigations into the findings and observations made during the inquiry. The committee resolved to hand over the report, together with the documentation and the entire record of evidence collected in the course of the inquiry, to the Zondo Commission for further investigation. This is the final report, which will be handed to the National Assembly, where the recommendations made will be pursued. The full report can be found on the following link
