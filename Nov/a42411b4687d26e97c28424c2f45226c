Parliament, Wednesday, 21 November 2018 –  The Portfolio Committee on Rural Development and Land Reform today received a presentation from the Land Bank on the Black Producers Commercialisation Blended Financing Model. This model aims to assist small-holder farmers to grow into commercial farmers. The committee would have liked to hear about the role of commodity organisations in providing comprehensive producer support services, among other things, but this was lacking from the presentation. The committee considers the Land Bank to be no different from a commercial bank and, therefore, requested at least a day to deal with the model’s policy framework and strategic issues. The committee also called for a joint meeting of the portfolio committees of Rural Development and Land Reform and of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries before the end of this term. Other stakeholders, such as Treasury and the Department of Performance, Monitoring and Evaluation, have been requested to be part of this meeting. ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE WHIP OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND LAND REFORM, MR PUMZILE JUSTICE NGWENYA.
