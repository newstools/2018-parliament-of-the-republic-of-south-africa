Parliament, Wednesday, 21 November 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Communications will re-advertise the four vacancies on the board of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), following the withdrawal of women and other candidates who, although they met the criteria as required by the Broadcasting Act No 4 1999, they withdrew their candidacies because they had other offers elsewhere. The committee remained with nine from a list of 12 shortlisted candidates and women representation decreased from five to three which is not reflective of the population demographics. The committee has agreed that those who already applied do not need to re-apply when the advert is put out and that shortlisting of candidates and interviews will be conducted in January 2019. “Although we have an obligation to ensure a full complement of the board, we are still comforted by the fact that the current board constitutes a quorum. The committee is committed to ensuring that the public broadcaster is able to carry out its legislative mandate,” said Prof Mkhize.
