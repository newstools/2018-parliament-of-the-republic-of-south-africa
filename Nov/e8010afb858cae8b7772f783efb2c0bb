Parliament, Thursday, 01 November 2018 – The Co-Chairperson of the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests, Mr. Omie Singh MP, has noted the Public Protector’s report on Minister Malusi Gigaba and recommendations that it must be referred to the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests. In terms of the rules, the report by the Public Protector is directed at the Presiding Officers of Parliament. It is the Presiding Officers that then direct the report to the committee for consideration and possible investigation. It is worth noting that the report was only released yesterday and the matter has not as yet been referred to the committee. It is only once the report is referred to the committee that the committee will be in a position to comment on it and consider possible investigation. The committee is guided by the Code of Ethical Conduct and Disclosure of Members’ Interest for Assembly and Permanent Council Members and will process the matter once it is referred to the committee. The committee cannot at this stage comment or consider the matter before it is officially tabled before it.
