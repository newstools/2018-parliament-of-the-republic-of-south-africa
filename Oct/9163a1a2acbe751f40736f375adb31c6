Parliament, Wednesday, 17 October 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) is disappointed by the fact that the Public Service Commission (PSC) today requested the committee to grant it another extension for the presentation of the report into the appointment of Mr Boitumelo Makgoro. Scopa has requested the PSC to make available the final report on the appointment of Mr Mokgoro, the chief financial officer (CFO) of the Property Management Trading Entity (PMTE) of the Department of Public Works, to the committee on Friday this week. This is in order for the committee to deal with the report next week Tuesday. Scopa had to delay again the discussion on this report as the PSC requested an extension due to the fact that the Minister of Public Works had requested 21 days to read and familiarise himself with the report as the executive authority of the department. The committee wants to know the circumstances that led to Mr Makgoro’s appointment through his company, Honey Cloud Enterprises. The explanations that were given to the committee last time were not satisfactory and that is why Scopa asked the PSC to investigate this matter. Scopa is waiting for this report so that it can understand how did he become the CFO of the PMTE. Scopa feels that the manner in which he was appointed was not in line with the normal public service regulations and processes.
