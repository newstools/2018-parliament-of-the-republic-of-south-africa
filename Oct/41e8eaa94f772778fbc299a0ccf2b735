Parliament, Wednesday, 31 October 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) this morning was forced to adjourn and postpone its meeting to later this evening due to the failure of the South African Police Service (SAPS) to submit and present the forensic report on Forensic Data Analysts (FDA). The committee had been informed by SAPS that the forensic report would be ready by the end of May 2018. That is why the committee had expected SAPS to give the report to Scopa members at the requested time in order to be ready for presentation today. Scopa has decided that it will continue with the hearing with SAPS on the forensic report this evening at 18:00. The hearing with SAPS will be held at E249, New Wing, National Assembly at 18:00.
