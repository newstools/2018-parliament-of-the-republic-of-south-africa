Parliament, Sunday, 28 October 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, will on Tuesday receive a briefing from the owners of Fireblade Aviation on the operation of the private terminal at OR Tambo International Airport. The delegation will be led by Mr Nicky Oppenheimer (Chairperson), Mr Jonathan Oppenheimer (CEO) and Mr Manne Dipico (Director). The briefing follows a visit by the committee on 30 August 2018 to the private terminal at OR Tambo. Following the visit, the committee raised a few concerns including the lack of a written agreement between the state and Fireblade regulating the operation as well as the impact the operation has on the state coffers as the running of this private terminal does not form part of the annual performance plan of a number of government departments that must operate in the port of entry environment. The briefing will also include a report on litigations undertook by both Fireblade and the Department. Details of the meeting Date: Tuesday, 30 October 2018
