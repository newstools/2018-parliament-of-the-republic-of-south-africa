Parliament, Tuesday, 30 October 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) today received a report on the National Framework for the Commercialisation of Black Producers from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The committee welcomed the report, as deliberate, targeted and well-defined interventions, as reported by DAFF, are needed to develop black smallholders into commercial farmers. The committee heard that 50 farmers in each province have been identified for assistance, making up a total of 450 smallholder farmers. However, the committee advised the department that, by cooperating with the Land Bank and the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform, this target could be increased. The committee requested that the department complete the plan, by including among other things farmers’ contact and other details, farms’ geographical coordinates and land ownership status. The department will then resubmit to the committee before the meeting with the Land Bank and the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform.
