Parliament, Tuesday, 23 October 2018 –The Portfolio Committee on Communications has rescheduled interviews of candidates who will fill the four vacancies at the board of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) to 6th November 2018. The initial date of the interviews was the 30th October 2018. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Humphrey Maxegwana, said that the rescheduling was made necessary by unforeseen circumstances, including a prolonged process of screening candidates by the State Security Agency as well as non-availability of some candidates on the initial date, due to prior engagements. The candidates are Mr Kevan Jones, Adv Motshedi Lekalakala, Mr Thabo Leshile, Mr Diliza Madikiza, Ms Unathi Magwentshu, Ms Vuyokazi Makhubalo, Adv Methews Mofokeng, Ms Bernedette Muthien, Mr Mergan Naidoo, Ms Thozama Nene, Mr Michael Nurick and Ms Jasmina Patel. The committee was briefed by the Independent Communication Authority of South Africa (ICASA) on Tuesday with regard to the Sports Broadcasting Regulations. The chairperson of the ICASA’s Sports Broadcasting Regulations Committee, Ms Palesa Kadi, said that the draft regulations will be published by the end of November 2018, and there after the public will be invited to submit inputs. The committee will invite ICASA back to get a report with regard to the final regulations before the end of March 2019.
