Parliament, Monday, 22 October 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and Training has commended the unwavering support which the University of Johannesburg (UJ) has provided to one of its students, Ms Cheryl Zondi, who testified in the rape trial of Pastor Timothy Omotoso at the Port Elizabeth High Court last week. The committee believes that the courage Ms Zondi displayed on the witness stand was, in part, due to the support she received from the university, as well as other organisations and individuals from all walks of life. “The same support should also be provided to other victims of rape and sexual harassment, when such cases are reported on campuses,” said Ms Connie September, Chairperson of the committee. Meanwhile, Ms September congratulated the administrations and student body of institutions of higher learning for a peaceful Students’ Representative Council (SRC) election season. “We congratulate student bodies who won elections and call for SRC induction by both Parliament and the Department of Higher Education and Training. Student leaders should know their roles, which include, among other things, assisting in registering students for 2019, ensuring that funds from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme are spent correctly and encouraging timeous applications,” said Ms September. Student leaders must also ensure that effective policies are in place and implemented, in order to protect women from gender-based violence. “Institutions of higher learning are places of learning and should be regarded as such. As the late former President Nelson Mandela once said that: ‘Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world’,” Ms September said.
