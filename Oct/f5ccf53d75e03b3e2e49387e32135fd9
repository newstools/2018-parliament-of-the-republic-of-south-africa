Parliament, Wednesday, 24 October 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Small Business Development has rejected the Small Enterprise Ombud Bill, as proposed by a member of the committee, Mr Toby Chance, under the provisions of the Private Member’s Bill. The Acting Chairperson of the committee, Mr Xitlhangoma Mabasa, said that the Bill was not rejected on the basis of its contents, but to avoid running a parallel process and incurring extra expenditure. The Department of Small Business Development is busy with the process of amending the National Small Business Act, No. 102 of 1996, which will make provision for accommodating the noble objectives proposed by Mr Chance. “It is better to have one mechanism that the department is working on, which we still have the opportunity to enrich. However, we urge them to work with speed, but not compromise on due diligence. At the moment, the Bill as proposed by Mr Chance does not assist our course,” said Mr Mabasa. The committee will await the department to table the National Small Business Amendment Bill in Parliament and process it thereafter.
