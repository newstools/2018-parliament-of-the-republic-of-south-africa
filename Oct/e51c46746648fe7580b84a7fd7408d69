Parliament, Tuesday, 30 October 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) today considered and made inputs on the consolidated summary of oral and written inputs on the Customary Initiation Bill. The committee considered the relevance of the definition of “abduction” for the Bill and decided that the definition of “kidnapping” covers both minors and adults when it comes to unlawful removal of someone. The committee also discussed and considered inputs on the definitions of “circumcision”, “curriculum” and “principal” of the initiation schools. The committee also considered the inputs into oversight and coordinating structures for customary initiation such as the National Initiation Oversight Committee (NIOC) and the Provincial Initiation Coordination Committees (PICC) and the composition of these structure and the roles they should play, particularly taking into consideration the various ways in which initiation is practiced in different parts of the country. The committee will tomorrow begin the clause by clause deliberations on the Bill where it will discuss in detail the clauses of the Bill. The clause by clause deliberations will take into consideration all the inputs that were made during the public participation process of the Bill. The oral and written inputs will greatly assist the committee in its deliberations tomorrow. ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON COOPERATIVE GOVERNANCE AND TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS, MR RICHARD MDAKANE.
