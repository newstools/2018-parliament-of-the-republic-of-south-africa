Parliament, Wednesday, 24 October 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Arts and Culture has learnt with shock and disbelief the reports of the untimely passing of the South African Hip Hop artist and king of Motswako Mr Jabulani Tsambo, better known as HHP. The committee is concerned that South Africa continues to lose some of the most influential artists at a young age and brimming with potential to drive artistic contributions to economic growth. "While we mourn this loss, we are cognisant of the immense contribution that HHP has given not only to the industry but to humanity in general. He was larger than life character that brought happiness through his music to throngs of music lovers in South Africa and beyond the borders of this country," said Ms Xoliswa Tom, the Chairperson of the committee. One of the markers of his contribution was his respect and appreciation for vernacular languages which he used as a vehicle to deliver his music. The committee extends its heartfelt condolences to his family and friends. "May his music and legacy live long in our hearts. Through his music he will live long beyond these sad days," Ms Tom concluded.
