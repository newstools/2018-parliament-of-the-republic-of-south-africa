Parliament, Tuesday, 16 October 2018 - The Ad Hoc Committee to Inquire into the Intervention in the North West Provincial Government in terms of section 100, is conducting a weeklong oversight in the North West province in terms 100 (2) (b) and (c) of the Constitution.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee Mr Charel de Beer says the objective of the oversight programme is to ensure good governance, sound financial management and accountability in the North West Provincial Government
	
	Today the committee began with oversight visits in the province and received briefings from the administrators on the state of affairs in the province since the national government's decision to put the entire provincial government under administration in terms of Section 100 of the Constitution.
	
	In order to cover more ground in the province the committee split into two groups with one focusing on the provincial capital, Mahikeng, and the other one focusing on Potchefstroom; Klerksdorp and surrounding areas.
	
	Group one of the committee started its day with a briefing from the Chairperson of the Provincial Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa), Mr Mohlakeng Mohlakeng, who
	emphasised the importance of rooting out corruption and strengthening accountability.
	
	The group also received briefings from officials of the Department of Public Works and Roads in the Kenneth Kaunda District as well as the administrators of the Department of Transport.
	
	The Administrator of the Department of Transport gave an overview of the alleged corruption in the awarding of contracts in the Learner Transport programme, which has cost the provincial government millions of rands in irregular expenditure.
	
	Chairperson De Beer said, referring to the presentations, the challenge was the lack of good governance, sound financial management and failure to adhere to the Public Finance Management Act and supply chain policies.
	
	The oversight visit programme continues tomorrow and the committee is scheduled to visit Tshepong Hospital and Alabama Primary School in Klerksdorp.
