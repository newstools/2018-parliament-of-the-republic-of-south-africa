Parliament, Monday, 22 October 2018 –The Portfolio Committee on Police is seriously concerned by the violent crimes committed with firearms that are possibly illegal, and calls on the police to fast-track investigations. Four people were shot and killed in two separate incidents over the weekend in Cape Town, including a ward councillor for Bloekombos. Another councillor was shot and killed last week in Umlazi, KwaZulu-Natal. In May this year, the portfolio committee in a media statement recommended that the police prioritise five steps, in order to effectively deal with the proliferation of illegal firearms: The committee is concerned by the steady growth in the illegal firearm pool. More than 800 firearms were lost or stolen from police members and more than 18 000 firearms were lost by members of the public or stolen in the 2017/18 financial year. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Francois Beukman, has called on gun-owning individuals and law-enforcement agencies to ensure that firearms are stored safely at all times. He extended heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased and called for thorough investigations and the arrest of the perpetrators.
