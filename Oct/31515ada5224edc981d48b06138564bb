Parliament, Thursday, 11 October 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Communications has undertaken to complete the process of filling the four vacant positions on the board of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) by the end of this year.
	
	This after the Chairperson of the Board, Mr Bongumusa Makhathini, made an appeal for a full support from the committee today, saying that a full complement of the board is crucial to effectively oversee corporate governance at the public broadcaster.
	
	The SABC appeared before the committee together with the Media Diversity and Development Agency (MDDA) to report on the annual reports and financial statements for the 2017/18 financial year.
	
	It then reported a disclaimer audit opinion, but the MDDA, on the other side, reported an unqualified audit opinion.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Humphrey Maxegwana, has congratulated both the Department of Communications and the SABC board for filling the three critical executive positions, namely Group Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
	
	He said the committee is confident that the executive will bring the requisite management, corporate governance and financial skills required to effectively implement the strategic roadmap of the SABC.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON COMMUNICATIONS, MR HUMPHREY MAXEGWANA.
