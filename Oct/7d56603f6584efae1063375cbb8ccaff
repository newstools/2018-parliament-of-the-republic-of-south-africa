Parliament, Thursday, 11 October 2018 – The Joint Constitutional Review Committee (CRC) has resolved to continue on 25 October with its oral submissions on whether section 25 of the Constitution should be amended to allow for expropriation of land without compensation. The committee will hold hearings on 25 and 26 October 2018 at Parliament. These hearings stem from written submissions made by the public in which they indicated they would like to make oral presentations. So far, 19 names have been identified to make oral submissions on the matter. The Co-Chairperson of the Committee, Mr Lewis Nzimande, said this number might increase as the secretariat was still trying to get hold of a few submitters. The committee was instructed by the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces to ascertain whether a review of section 25 of the Constitution and other clauses is necessary, to make it possible for the state to expropriate land in the public interest without compensation, and also to propose constitutional amendments where necessary. The committee has already held hearings in all the country’s nine provinces and a week of oral submissions were held last month in Parliament. The committee also elected Mr Stanford Maila as the Acting Co-Chairperson of the committee. Mr Nzimande said the debate on the final report of the committee is likely to take place between 26 or 28 November 2018.
