Parliament, Wednesday, 31 October 2018 – The Multi-Party Women’s Caucus (MPWC) is very proud and pleased with the announcement made by the Minister of Finance, Mr Tito Mboweni, that value-added tax (VAT) will be removed from sanitary products. The committee will, nonetheless, continue to advocate for free sanitary products. The committee Chairperson, Ms Rosalia Storey Morutoa, said the MPWC has been engaging with the National Treasury about this issue and the announcement is an affirmation of its social activism. “We want to assure the women out there that we are continuing with our engagements on sanitary dignity, as we advocate for the provision of free sanitary products to indigent women and girls.” Ms Morutoa said the fifth Parliament MPWC is committed in lobbying, influencing and advocating for the emancipation of all women in South Africa. This includes identifying and addressing barriers and stereotypes affecting women today. The MPWC has no oversight function over the executive and achieves its target through social activism, while moving away from being an event-based structure. “We appreciate the support and cooperation of various civil society and non-government organisations that collaborated with us on this journey,” said Ms Morutoa.
