Parliament, Tuesday, 6 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Communications has noted with keen interest the decision by the Films and Publications Board (FPB) to temporarily unban X-rated local film, Inxeba (The Wound). The committee understands that the decision was taken pending a court challenge to review the age restriction on the film by producers, Film Distribution Ltd and Uhuru Media Ltd. Although expressing confidence in the FPB, the Committee has called on the entity to strive for a broader consultation with the concerned stakeholders when dealing with controversial films like Inxeba. “We will await the final decision on the matter, following the review proceedings at the Gauteng North High Court on 28 March 2018,” said Mr Humphrey Maxegwana, the Chairperson of the Committee. The committee has welcomed the adoption of the Films and Publications Board Amendment Bill by the National Assembly today.
