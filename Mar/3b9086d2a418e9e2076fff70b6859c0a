Parliament, Tuesday, 13 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises has agreed to summon former SAA board chairperson Ms Dudu Myeni, Mr Duduzane Zuma and the Gupta brothers to appear before as it investigates the mismanagement of state funds at state-owned enterprises. Chairperson for the inquiry Ms Zukiswa Rantho said, Ms Myeni has been invited by the committee twice and has indicated that she is unable to appear before the committee on both occasions. Members of the committee said they will not be held to ransom by Ms Myeni as it is in her best interest to appear before the inquiry. The committee has not received a sick note from Ms Myeni. Members of the committee proposed that an independent evaluation to verify if she is indeed sick. The committee is of the view that it would be impossible to finish the work of the inquiry without the testimony of Ms Myeni including that of Mr Zuma and the Gupta family. Ms Rantho said issuing of summons is the last resort that the committee had to undertake as invitations have been issued without any success.
