Parliament, Tuesday, 13 March 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts’ (Scopa) briefing with the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) that was scheduled for this evening has been cancelled. Scopa has made three attempts to date to invite the IMC to brief it on the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and South African Post Office (Sapo) payments of social grants to no avail. Scopa has not received any communication from the IMC to confirm attendance for this evening. Sassa has also indicated that it was unaware of the meeting between Scopa and the IMC scheduled for today. Therefore, Scopa has decided to cancel the briefing. Scopa remains concerned about the many conflicting reports about the ability of Sassa and Sapo to meet the deadline of 1 April 2018, which might negatively affect grant recipients.
