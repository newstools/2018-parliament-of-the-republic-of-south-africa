Parliament, Tuesday, 20 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and Training noted with delight the appointment of Prof Mamokgethi Phakeng to the position of a Vice-Chancellor at the University of Cape Town (UCT). We celebrate that Prof Phakeng’s appointment addresses the under-representation of women, especially at the level of Vice-Chancellors. We look forward at our earliest convenience as a committee to engage with Prof Phakeng through our oversight responsibility over the university to address transformation challenges, culture at UCT – a place for all to feel welcome amongst others, contributing to the development agenda of South Africa and to produce students of high calibre. We wish Prof Phakeng the best in this formidable task and we urge all the university community to work together with her to collectively take the University to even greater heights.
