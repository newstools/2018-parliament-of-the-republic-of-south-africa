Parliament, Wednesday, 28 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries invited the Portfolio Committee on Health today to received briefings from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; the Department of Trade and Industry; and the Department of Health on how they have responded to the listeriosis outbreak and what is currently being done to address the crisis. The committees welcomed the fact that the Department of Health announced listeriosis as a notifiable disease. The members, however, were very concerned to learn that there are no compulsory specifications for listeria and standards on processed meat products are voluntary on the part of the producers. In this regard, the committees highlighted the urgent need for the Department of Trade and Industry to develop norms and standards for all processed meat products In addition, the committee requested the fast-tracking of the establishment of the Food Control Agency, to ensure strengthened inter-governmental relations and coordination of food safety practices. The committee resolved that after three months, both portfolio committees should sit again for a progress report and feedback from the three departments, including the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation.
