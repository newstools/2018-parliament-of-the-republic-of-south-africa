Parliament, Wednesday 7 March 2018 – Parliament urges Members of Parliament, employees and stakeholders inside and outside of the public sector to use the remaining days of the stakeholder satisfaction survey to assist in reflecting on its delivery of parliamentary services to beneficiaries. The research project, launched in December 2017, will be closing for submission of questionnaires to the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) by Friday, 9 March 2018. The HSRC, a renowned research agency, has been commissioned by Parliament to independently evaluate its delivery of services as part of strengthening Parliament’s relations with internal and external stakeholders. In its strategic plan for the fifth term, Parliament had identified the engagement of stakeholders as one of the key pillars for ensuring progressive execution of its three-legged constitutional mandate of law making, executive oversight and citizen participation. Parliament, working with HSRC, has adopted a number of interventions to promote greater awareness and participation of various beneficiaries of parliamentary services. Parliament urges potential respondents to heed the call and respond in numbers to ensure that the institution improves its service to the people and stakeholders. The questionnaires are available below – kindly choose the one appropriate to you: https://tinyurl.com/yc7qteyu
