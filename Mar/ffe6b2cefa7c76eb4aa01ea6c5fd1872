Parliament, Friday, 2 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Health is shocked by the recent media reports that the North West provincial Department of Health is spending millions each month on private ambulances. The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Lindelwa Dunjwa, said it is outrageous that a government department uses private ambulances for emergency medical services (EMS) that should be provided by the state. Exacerbating the matter are the reports that the provincial department paid a Gupta-linked company millions to provide mobile clinic services, Ms Dunjwa said. “It cannot be right that we have private companies performing duties that are a key competency of government. The use of private ambulances is costly and it is negatively impacting on the provincial department’s budget. Outsourcing of services such as EMS further impacts on employment opportunities for people who could be directly employed by the state.” “We are not taking this kindly and it is unacceptable. We will not allow corruption to rear its ugly head in the health sector.” In the coming few days, the committee will invite the national Department of Health and all provincial health departments to appear before it to account on these issues in the public domain.
