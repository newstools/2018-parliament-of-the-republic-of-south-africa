Subsequent to the minister’s letter, the committee meeting scheduled for Tuesday has been cancelled. The Chairperson for the inquiry, Ms Zukiswa Rantho, said: “I decided to send the letter to the members of the committee to inform them about the Minister’s request instead of waiting until Tuesday for the scheduled meeting.
