Parliament, Wednesday, 14 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources will write to the House Chairperson, Mr Cedrick Frolick, to ask for someone with a law background to lead evidence in the inquiry on allegations of state capture at the Department of Mineral Resources. The evidence leader will assist in finalising the inquiry’s terms of reference, investigate evidence and identify key witnesses. The committee would like to begin with the inquiry soon after the Easter recess and will have 60 days to finalise its work thereafter. “The allegations have been hanging for far too long, thereby necessitating a need to move with speed, without compromising the integrity of the process,” said Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, the Chairperson of the committee.
