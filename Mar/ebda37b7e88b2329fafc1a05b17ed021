Parliament, Wednesday, 14 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Basic Education has noted with grave concern the latest allegations of sexual assaults by a police forensic investigator at the AB Xuma Primary School in Soweto. Committee Chairperson Ms Nomalungo Gina said this is extremely worrying as these learners were being prepared for the trail in which they are to testify against a school patroller who allegedly sexually assaulted 55 learners. It is now alleged that the police forensic officer sexually molested two of the learners on Monday as he was preparing them for trial. "This must be condemned in the harshest possible terms. Our kids need to be safe in the school environment. The last thing the committee expected was for these young learners to be allegedly molested a second time at the hands of someone they trusted." We would like to express our sadness to the parents of all affected learners and wishes to assure them of our support. The Committee would like to express appreciation to the Gauteng Education Department for acting swiftly on the matter and call for justice to prevail. "We call on all officials to work together to bring this to a speedy conclusion. The South African Police Services and all education officials must work together to ensure justice for our children. The perpetrators should be dealt with harshly in order to send a strong message out against such barbaric behaviour."
