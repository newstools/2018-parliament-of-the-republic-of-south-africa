Parliament, Tuesday 27 March 2018 – The National Assembly approved the Political Party Funding Bill at its sitting this afternoon and the Bill will now go to the National Council of Provinces for consideration. The Bill proposes, among others, regulating and making transparent private donations to political parties represented in Parliament and the Provincial Legislatures. It is the culmination of extensive public consultation, involving written submissions and public hearings. In June 2017, the National Assembly resolved to establish a multi-party ad hoc committee to inquire into and make recommendations, by 30 November 2017, on the funding of political parties represented in Parliament and the Provincial Legislatures. On 28 November 2017, the committee tabled the Political Party Funding Bill in the Assembly and recommended that Parliament pass the Bill. The Bill lapsed at the end of 2017. On 28 February, the Bill was revived and the committee re-established with a mandate to consider and report in more detail on the financial implications of the proposed Bill. It tabled a report on these on 20 March 2018 and the Assembly considered and approved this report today. In this report, the committee proposed no amendments to the Bill tabled on 28 November 2017. The regulation of political party funding is key to our constitutional democracy and will improve transparency, accountability and fairness in political party funding.
