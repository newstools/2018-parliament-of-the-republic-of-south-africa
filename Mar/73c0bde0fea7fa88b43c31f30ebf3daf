Parliament, Monday, 12 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee has noted with shock the second incident in a few weeks where a police officer has killed his partner and committed suicide. The incident in Ocean View follows an incident in Lentegeur near Cape Town a few weeks ago. The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Mr Francois Beukman, said that work stress and personal circumstances is normally the driver of these very tragic incidents. “SAPS members who experience stress due to operational duties and personal challenges should utilise the wellness programmes that are offered by the SAPS. Family members are also urged to report abnormal behaviour to the supervisors of SAPS members,” he said. Mr Beukman said that station and unit commanders should also take proactive steps if they see members are not well. Family members have a duty to report abnormal behaviour. Service firearms should immediately be confiscated if risk factors come to the fore. The Portfolio Committee on Police will raise the matter tomorrow with the National Commissioner on Police to ensure that wellness protocols are adhered to and the necessary support is given for SAPS members who experience wellness challenges.
