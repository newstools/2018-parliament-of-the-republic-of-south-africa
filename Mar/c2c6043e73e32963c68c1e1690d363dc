Parliament, Monday, 05 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements will tomorrow (Tuesday, 06 March) receive a briefing from the City of Cape Town and eThekwini metropolitan municipalities on plans to improve their poor spending patterns of the Urban Settlements Development Grant (USDG), which is for upgrading informal settlements. Last week, the committee heard from the national Department of Human Settlements that the two metropolitan municipalities have spent just below 30% of their USDG allocation to date. The committee was concerned to hear of this poor performance, particularly as municipalities’ financial year ends on 30 June. Details of the meeting: Venue: Committee Room V119, First Floor, Old Assembly Building Time: 09h00 ISSUED BY PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HUMAN SETTLEMENTS, MS NOCAWE MAFU.
