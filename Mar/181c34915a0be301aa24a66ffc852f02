Parliament, Tuesday, 20 March 2018 – In October 2017, the Standing Committee on the Auditor-General resolved to amend the Public Audit Act, No 25 of 2004. The National Assembly (NA), accordingly, granted the committee permission to proceed with a Bill. In January 2018, the committee then published the Draft Public Audit Amendment Bill in the Government Gazette to invite public comments, and 35 written submissions were received. On the 6, 7 and 9 of March, the committee held public hearings on the Bill. It also consulted extensively with the National Treasury and the Auditor-General of South Africa. Today, the committee has agreed on several policy matters emanating from the consultations and instructed the Parliamentary Legal Services to include them in the next draft of the Bill. The committee will meet in early May to consider the draft Bill, which it intends to submit to the NA before the end of June 2018.
