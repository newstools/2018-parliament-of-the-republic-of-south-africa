Parliament, Thursday, 15 March 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) will ensure that the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation (known as the Hawks), the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and other law enforcement agencies appear together at its next sitting, to ensure a more cohesive approach to combatting corruption. Scopa Chairperson Mr Themba Godi and other committee members believe that integration and collaboration between these agencies will result in a “more effective criminal justice system”. The NPA was briefing Scopa on progress with various corruption cases in both the private and public sectors, including Steinhoff, state capture, Trillian, Estina, the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa and Eskom. In relation to the citizenship status of the Guptas, NPA head Mr Shaun Abrahams told Scopa that the NPA will meet the Department of Home Affairs to determine the exact status of the Guptas’ residency in South Africa. The meeting is scheduled for this week. Mr Abrahams once again informed Scopa that budgetary constraints were impacting negatively on the effectiveness of the NPA. “The NPA has now reached a state of emergency as a direct result of the impact the budget cuts have had on the institution,” negatively impacting on its legal and constitutional mandate, he said. Scopa resolved to support the NPA’s application to National Treasury for additional funds so that it can deal effectively with corruption.
