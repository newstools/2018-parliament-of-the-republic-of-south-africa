Parliament, Tuesday, 13 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries today received briefings from the Auditor-General and the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) on the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries’ 2018/19 Annual Performance Plan (APP). The committee advised the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation to revert back and discuss with the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on the issues presented, which are critical for food security and Operation Phakisa, including rural infrastructure. Medium term expenditure targets must be achieved. The Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation must meet with the technical team of Operation Phakisa. Programme 3 on food security and agrarian reform on the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries’ APP is dependent on the Department of Rural Department and Land Reform and provincial departments of agriculture, which are supposed to contribute to the outcome. Therefore, DPME must be able to see how the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform compliments or meets the targets of the Medium Term Strategic Framework. Chairperson Ms Rosina Machwene Semenya requested the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries department to develop a programme to assist small-holder farmers to access the 30% that is set aside to assist small, medium and micro-enterprises. She would also like to see how agri-parks will feature in the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and will await a report from the department on this.
