Parliament, 14 March 2018 – The Standing Committee on Finance notes the resignation of Mr Jonas Makwakwa. The committee has no evidence that Mr Makwakwa or Ms Kerry-Ann Elskie, his partner, are guilty of any irregularities. However, if there is a case to answer, it must proceed through the criminal justice system and the pair will not escape this by resigning. “A key concern has been the unacceptable way in which the South African Revenue Service (Sars) has managed this matter,” said Mr Yunus Carrim, the Chairperson of the Committee. The committee will continue engagements with Sars on the matter, to consider whether there is a need to amend legislation or regulations to reduce the prospects of a similar controversy emerging in the future. The committee also believe that the conduct of international law firm Hogan Lovells in this matter must be investigated further. “We feel very strongly that in view of the role that Sars plays, it’s important that senior Sars officials are not just above reproach, but are seen to be so,” said Mr Carrim.
