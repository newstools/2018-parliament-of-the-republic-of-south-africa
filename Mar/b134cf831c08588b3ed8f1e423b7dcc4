Parliament, Friday, 09 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs urges all South Africans to make use of the registration weekend presented by the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) to update their details on the voters’ roll. The Committee reiterates that the validity of the voters’ roll is one of the single most important pillars of a democratic state. As such, South Africans must commit to ensuring that the voters’ roll is up to date. While it is important for first time voters to register so that they have an opportunity to make their voices heard, it is similarly important for previous voters to ensure that they are registered in the correct voter district. This will enable them to vote in the 2019 national and provincial elections.
