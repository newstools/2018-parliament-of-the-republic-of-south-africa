	Ladies and gentlemen I greet you this afternoon and thank you for your responsiveness. You would most probably recall that the full entourage of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) led by the Chairperson, Hon Thandi Modise, and working with the Provincial Legislature of the Eastern Cape, walked the streets, listened to the people of this area, and left with a list of service delivery challenges and undertakings, while leaving behind recommendations for action. That was in November 2016 during the second phase of our flagship programme of Taking Parliament to the People (TPTTP), covering the Alfred Nzo District and Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipalities. While we focussed our attentions primarily on education, health, infrastructure and economic development, ALL matters raised by participants in the public hearings and written submissions were accepted and considered. Since then, there has been a lot of work done in many areas to respond to the citizens’ service delivery challenges and aspirations, while in some areas we experienced inertia on the part of some implementers of government programmes. This time, about 50 members of the NCOP accompanied by Members of the Provincial Legislature are back in the Eastern Cape for the third leg of TPTTP. This third leg was introduced to further strengthen our efforts to hold the executive accountable while also optimising citizen participation in governance. Between November 2016 and now, the NCOP has closely monitored work taking place and generated a progress report. The progress report gives a clinical outline of all Executive undertakings and recommendations made by the NCOP for resolving service delivery challenges. It also maps out progress made. We wish to share with you this report, copies of which will be made available to you in various formats. For your ease of reference we wish to outline a high-level summary as follows: I thank you ___________________________________________________________________ NB: For interviews with NCOP Deputy Chairperson Mr R Tau can be arranged with/through Modise Kabeli 081 7159969 / Mlindi Mpindi 081 7167329) Issued by Parliament of the Republic of South Africa Enquiries: Moloto Mothapo 082 3706930 A joint committee of Parliament monitors improvements in the quality of life and status of women in South Africa.Read more
