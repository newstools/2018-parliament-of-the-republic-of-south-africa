Parliament, Tuesday, 6 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Transport has finalised the terms of reference for the investigation into maladministration at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). Committee Chairperson Ms Dikeledi Magadzi said timeframes must now be finalised and an application for additional sittings submitted to the House Chair of Committees. “The interest of the committee is to provide safe, affordable and reliable rail transport to our people. [The committee] must see that we have a well-governed state entity that is able to honour its service-delivery obligation to the people, and a commitment to account to Parliament and the department,” Ms Magadzi said. “The Auditor-General has in the past highlighted challenges that Prasa has seemed unable to resolve. The process now is at a stage where the committee needs to develop timelines and prioritisation of key issues needing urgent attention. This might require that the committee sits at irregular times. Once the plan has been finalised, an application for additional sittings will be submitted to the office of the House Chair,” Ms Magadzi said. Among the issues the committee will look into are the irregular and illegal contracts entered into with service providers and other issues raised in Derailed, the Public Protector’s 2015 report on Prasa.
