Parliament, Wednesday, 14 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on International Relations and Cooperation supports the proposed reform of the United Nations (UN) Security Council. The Chairperson of the Committee, Mr Siphosezwe Masango, said: “The reform of the UN architecture to make it reflective of new global dynamics, such as new nation states, the end of the Cold War and demographic realities is long overdue, 72 years after its conception in 1945.” The Committee received an update briefing from the Department of International Relations and Cooperation about progress on the reform of the UN in general, and its Security Council in particular. The African continent’s position is based on the Ezulwini Consensus of 2005, in terms of which the continent demands two permanent seats on the Security Council, with a veto right. The Committee expressed its gratitude for the African Union’s endorsement in January 2018 for South Africa’s candidature for a two-year, non-permanent membership on the Security Council. It believes that South Africa will use this platform to champion the African Agenda 2063, peaceful resolution of conflicts and a celebration of the progressive ideals of the late former President, Mr Nelson Mandela.
