Parliament, Friday, 22 March 2018 – The Select Committee on Social Services welcomes the extension of South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) contract with Cash Paymaster Services for payment of social grants. While the six months’ extension is welcomed as it will ensure that beneficiaries receive their much-needed grants, it remains concerned that Sassa had to request an extension in the first place. As such, the Committee urges Sassa to work with speed to finalise the processes towards South African Post Office taking over the payment of grants. In line with this, the committee will urgently call Sassa and the Department of Social Development to outline the process going forward, which must have clear timelines. “We are hoping this will be the last request for an extension and that this matter will be finalised soon,” said Ms Cathy Dlamini, the Chairperson of the committee.
