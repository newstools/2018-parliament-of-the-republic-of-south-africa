Parliament, Tuesday, 27 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises tasked with the inquiry into the mismanagement of state funds at state-owned enterprises met on Tuesday to discuss a way forward for the inquiry. The committee noted with deep concern the threats received by phone call on the weekend by the Chairperson of the Inquiry, Ms Zukiswa Rantho. The committee agreed that the matter must be reported to law enforcement agencies so that a security threat analysis can be done and proper action can be taken. The committee also believes the matter should be reported to the Speaker of Parliament. In its closed meeting, the committee has decided to accept affidavits from the individuals who have indicated their interest in making submissions to the inquiry. The committee set a final date of 13 April as the deadline for submitting the affidavits. The committee took a decision that summons will be served to the outstanding witnesses, the Gupta brothers, Mr Duduzane Zuma and Ms Dudu Myeni. The committee is planning to finalise its first report in May and the final draft will be tabled in Parliament in mid-June.
