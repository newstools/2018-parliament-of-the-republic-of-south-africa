Parliament, Thursday, 08 March 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Sport and Recreation condemns the vicious attack on South African triathlete Mr Mhlengi Gwala that occurred in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Mr Gwala, who was training near the University of KwaZulu-Natal, was attacked by three men who dragged him into a nearby bush and attempted to saw off his legs. While Mr Gwala managed to drag himself to safety, he sustained severe injuries to both legs and is currently receiving treatment at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital. This criminal attack undermines the country’s objective of building a united South Africa and the committee calls on the South African Police Service to bring to justice those found guilty of the attack. The committee wishes Mr Gwala a speedy recovery and is hopeful that he will soon be able to participate in his sporting activities once again and hoist our country’s flag high.
