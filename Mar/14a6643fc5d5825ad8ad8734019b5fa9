Parliament, Thursday, 8 March 2018 – The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) is stepping up the monitoring of coalface service delivery, as it revisits the Buffalo City and Alfred Nzo Municipalities next week, from 12 to 16 March 2018. Since its Taking Parliament to the People (TPTTP) visit to the Eastern Cape in 2016, the NCOP has been closely tracking progress made in undertakings made and interventions aimed at addressing service delivery challenges and people’s aspirations. During this visit, the NCOP will be inspecting projects and giving feedback to the residents of King William’s Town, Mdantsane and Duncan Village in the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality, as well as Matatiele, Ntabankulu, UMzimvubu and Mbizana in the Alfred Nzo District Municipality. Nearly 50 members of the National Council of Provinces are segmented into seven groups that will visit all projects covered during the previous visit, and in the afternoons they would report back to a series of public meetings to be held at various venues across the Buffalo City Metropolitan and Alfred Nzo District Municipalities. The Taking Parliament to the People programme was launched by the NCOP in 2002, as means of closing distance and other barriers between the citizens of the country and their parliamentary representatives. In all the engagements the NCOP will be working hand-in-glove with the provincial legislature and the local leadership, signifying progressive improvements in cross-legislative sector coordination. The TPTTP is the NCOP’s flagship programme that enhances the execution of its constitutional mandate relating to cooperative governance and inter-governmental relations.
