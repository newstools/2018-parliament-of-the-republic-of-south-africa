Parliament, Friday, 14 September 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has noted various media articles implicating a senior official of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on corruption. The Chairperson of the Committee, Ms Rosina Semenya said that the committee views the allegations seriously and calls on the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to commence its investigations as soon as possible, as the official implicated has been on suspension with pay since July 2018. “We do not want to see a situation where the official is tried by the media before the internal disciplinary processes have commenced and finalised” said Ms Semenya.
