Parliament, Tuesday, 18 September 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and Training has called on students at Durban University of Technology, Mangosuthu University of Technology, and University of Zululand not to revenge for the killings of fellow students. Committee Chairperson, Ms Connie September, condemned the killings and said students ought to let the law enforcement agencies deal with the matter. “The committee wishes to send its condolences to the families and friends of the deceased. But also wishes to call on the student community not take the law into their own hands. We are saddened by this spike of violent killings at KwaZulu-Natal universities,” Ms September said. She said necessary actions needed to be taken to ensure that university campuses across the country, and student residences remain secure, safe and conducive for learning especially ahead of the year-end examinations. Three students were allegedly murdered by other students at the three universities on the weekend.
