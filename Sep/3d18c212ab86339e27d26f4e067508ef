Parliament, Wednesday, 04 September 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Police has reiterated its call for adequate support to the Office of the Priority Crime Investigation Judge to enable it to function optimally. The DPCI Judge appeared before the committee today and lamented the lack of adequate support from the Civilian Secretariat for Police which is hindering the office to effectively do its job. “While the committee acknowledges the financial constraints that all government departments are facing, it has emphasised the importance of adequately staffing the office and enabling the Judge to do his work rather than spend time on administrative issues,” said Mr Francois Beukman, the Chairperson of the committee. The committee will canvass the issue of adequate support to the office with the Minister of Police when the committee meets the Minister next Tuesday. The committee remains concerned that the Judge continues to face challenges despite the fact that the committee raises the issue with successive Ministers of police. In the context of the current cases, the office must deal with the committee as the committee considers it unacceptable that the office operates with only two junior investigators, junior office administrators in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Meanwhile, the committee has raised a concern on the lack of research capacity within the Civilian Secretariat office as that affects the ability of the office to offer viable researched policy solutions to the challenges faced by the police. “The committee is of the view that research is necessary if effective amendments are to be made to the policy on policing in the country. The committee has urged the office to capacitate itself to deliver on this important imperative,” Mr Beukman concluded.
