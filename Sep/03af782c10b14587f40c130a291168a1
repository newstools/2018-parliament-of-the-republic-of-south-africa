Parliament, Thursday, 20 September 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and Training has called on provinces to first discuss international studies programmes with the Department of Higher Education and Training before students are sent abroad. The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Connie September, said it is important that students and their parents were also part of the negotiations with the DHET. The committee is currently conducting a study tour of the Russian system, and on Thursday visited the Lomonosov Moscow State University to find out more about such issues as university governance, management, funding and student financial assistance. The committee was alerted of life challenges South African students encountered in Russia, but also a situation involving about 53 medical students from Mpumalanga at Astrakhan State Medical University. The committee was unable to visit the university. Members are very disturbed that the embassy in Russia was not informed about the Astrakhan State Medical University programme but has to deal with the matter now. The committee will write to the MEC for Education in Mpumalanga, and the company involved to explain the challenges of the students. If that fails, we will ask them to come to Parliament. The committee understands the plight of the students and will get to the bottom of it.
