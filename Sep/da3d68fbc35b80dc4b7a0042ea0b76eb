Parliament, Tuesday, 18 September 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Mr Francois Beukman, announced this morning that permission has been obtained from the House Chairperson responsible for committees, Mr Cedric Frolick, to convene a special meeting on South African Police Service (Saps) security measures at Parliament. The meeting will take place on Wednesday, 26 September 2018, at 10:00. The National Commissioner of Police, General Kehla Sitole, and the relevant commanders responsible for national key points will be requested to brief the committee on progress regarding the recent shooting incident at Parliament and the review of Saps security measures at Parliament. The committee has also engaged the Portfolio Committee on Public Works and both chairpersons have agreed to hold a joint meeting. The Director-General of the Department of Public Works is expected to give a detailed outline of security infrastructure implemented in Parliament since 2015. Mr Beukman said it is vital that both portfolio committees receive assurances that security measures at Parliament are at an adequate level. "Any breach of security at the national legislature, especially where firearms are involved, should be properly investigated, and current measures should be reviewed and strengthened," Mr Beukman said.
