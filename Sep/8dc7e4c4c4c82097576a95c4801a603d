Parliament, Tuesday, 25 September 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Communications has welcomed the strategic roadmap of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) which, among other things, highlights the possibility of implementing Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act (Act No. 66 of 1995) as a measure to cut costs. The roadmap is anchored on six strategic pillars, that include financial sustainability, content and platforms, digital, human capital, governance and, partnerships. The committee heard that the public broadcaster is currently in a process to consult with organised labour, on a regular basis, in order to find an amicable way to implement Section 189. SABC's Group Chief Executive Officer, Mr Madoda Mxakwe, said that the employee cost for the 2017/18 financial year amounts to R3.1 billion which is 42% of the total expenditure of R7.3 billion. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Humphrey Maxegwana, said that a follow up meeting should be arranged with the board to get progress report with regard to implementation of the roadmap. “The strategic roadmap has highlighted some critical aspects which could bring about positive results. However, the issue of Section 189 should be approached with due diligence and be concluded expeditiously in order to restore certainty among the workers,” said Mr Maxegwana. Mr Maxegwana also commended the SABC for coming up with turnaround plans to improve collection of the television licence fees.
