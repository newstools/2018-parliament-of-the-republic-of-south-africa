Parliament, Wednesday, 26 September 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, Mr Hlomani Chauke, has welcomed the broad visa-related reforms announced on Monday by the Minister of Home Affairs, Mr Malusi Gigaba. The reforms are aimed at boosting tourism and implementing various visa modifications, to enable ease of travel for business people and to attract much-needed investment. The committee also welcomed moves to increase the list of African countries that do not require visas to visit South Africa. This move has the potential to enhance intra-Africa trade and will give impetus to the Africa Free Trade Agreement, recently signed by South Africa. Furthermore, the committee welcomed visa reforms intended to benefit business people from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (Brics) countries. While the committee acknowledged the need for visa reform, it has also emphasised the need for immigration reforms that achieve a balance between security, international obligations and economic growth. After the recess, the committee will convene a meeting with the department aimed at getting a full briefing on the reforms and how they will be implemented. This will ensure that the committee is adequately equipped to do oversight on the implementation.
