Parliament, Saturday, 15 September 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Sport and Recreation has welcomed the Springboks’ momentous victory against the All Blacks. The kind of commitment the Boks put into the effort was a marvel to watch. It confirms that South Africa is once again a force to be reckoned with. The Springbok beat New Zealand in an away fixture of the championships earlier on Saturday. Ms Dlulane said rugby was a sport of choice for many South Africans and its ability in fostering social cohesion should never be underestimated. Again this win proves that South Africans are a winning nation.
