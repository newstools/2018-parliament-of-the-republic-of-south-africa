Parliament, Thursday, 27 September 2018 – The Joint Standing Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interest wishes to congratulate Advocate Mthuthuzeli Vanara, who is leaving Parliament, for the sterling work he has done for the institution. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Omie Singh, said Adv Vanara is a true professional, who public servants should seek emulate. The committee admired his work ethic, as he always sought to make a success of any assignment allocated to him. The committee wishes him well, with much appreciation that he is not completely lost to public service. Adv Vanara’s cautious and quiet nature when approaching assignments set him above the rest. He has set the bar so high in the public sector and Parliament regrets losing the experience of such a respected official. He redefined the role of public servants and what it means to be of service to the country. The committee highly appreciated the excellent work Adv Vanara performed for the committee. We wish him well in his future endeavours.
