Parliament, Wednesday, 26 September 2018 – The Portfolio on Human Settlements has committed to process the Property Practitioners Bill before the dissolution of the fifth Parliament. This commitment was made during stakeholder engagements on the Bill in Polokwane.
	
	The majority view remained that the Bill is long overdue and must be processed with speed to remedy challenges in the archaic Property Practitioners Bill Estate Agency Affairs Act of 1976. Furthermore, the dominant voice remains that the property sector in the country needs to transform and systems must be put in place to open up the sector for new entrants. ‘
	
	A majority of stakeholders called for the Bill to include the regularisation of the entire sector to curtail the boom in private sales, which stakeholders say has the potential to undermine the intentions of the current Bill.
	
	Town planners have also made calls to be included as part of the composition of people to be considered for appointment on the board of Authority.
	
	Furthermore, the committee has acknowledged concerns that the Bill currently is more focused on regulating the industry and less on support, especially for new entrants in the sector. The invaluable contributions made by stakeholders will be considered for addition to the Bill, to ensure the transformation of this important sector.
	
	The committee will tomorrow engage stakeholders in Bloemfontein.
