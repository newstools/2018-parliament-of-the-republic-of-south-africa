Parliament, Tuesday, 25 September 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on International Relations and Cooperation has congratulated President Cyril Ramaphosa, as he unveiled a life-sized statue of former President Nelson Mandela at the 73rd General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) at its headquarters in New York on Monday. Mr Ramaphosa is leading a strong South African delegation to the assembly. Committee Chairperson Mr Siphosezwe Masango said the honour befitted the vision and principles Mr Mandela lived by. The statue embodies the peaceful and tolerant world that Mr Mandela worked to see realised during his lifetime, as a champion of international peace and justice. The committee also welcomed the effort the Department of the International Relation and Cooperation put into this project. The committee is confident that South Africa will play a pivotal role in promoting international peace and justice, mediation and reconciliation when it assumes a third term as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council from 2019 to 2020. The Nelson Mandela Peace Summit that took place yesterday during the 73rd UN General Assembly is a befitting gesture by the international community in celebrating Nelson Mandela’s contribution to humanity.
