Parliament,Wednesday, 22 August 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services has postponed to next week, Wednesday, 29 August, the agenda to consider and deliberate on the written reply of the Public Protector, Adv Busisiwe Mkhwebane, on whether or not she should be removed from office. The Chief Whip of the Democratic Alliance, Mr John Steenhuisen, wrote to the Speaker of the National Assembly (NA), Ms Baleka Mbete, to ask that a process be put in place to institute the removal of the Public Protector, alleging that she is not fit to hold office. The Speaker then referred the matter to the committee, which then invited Mr Steenhuisen to make oral presentation with regard to his request to the office of the Speaker. Subsequently, the committee took a decision to allow Adv Mkhwebane to make a written reply with regard to Mr Steenhuisen’s proposal and allegations. The committee will meet again next week to consider and deliberate on the Public Protector’s reply.
