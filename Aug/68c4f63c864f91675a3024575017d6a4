Parliament, Sunday, 12 August 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Economic Development will tomorrow, Monday 13 August 2018, commence its week-long oversight visit in the North West Province. The committee has in the past identified the tourism sector as a point of oversight interest. The sector is at the centre of the South African economic policy regime and has been identified as key-job driver in both the National Growth and Industrial Policy Action Plans. Previous briefings received by the committee have revealed serious competition and transformation related challenges which have made it difficult for smaller players to enter and thrive in the sector. While the committee seeks to deal with these issues through the Competition Amendment Bill [B 23—2018], it has identified big projects like Sun City, amongst others, to assess its (market) dominance and influence in the region and province. The committee is scheduled to meet with the Sun City management to discuss and be briefed on the areas of ownership, management, job creation, enterprise development, the number of entrepreneurs and black owned B&B & Guest Houses in the area. The committee is also scheduled to have briefings and deliberations with the management and stakeholders of the Madikwe establishment, including the relevant municipality on tourism in the area Sites to be visited during the week include Tourism Incubator pilot project in Moruleng which is the first of its kind in the country, the Mphebatho Museum in Moruleng Village as supported by the Bakgatla Traditional Authority (VTSD) and the "Homestay" programme in the Moruleng area. Details of the oversight visits are as follows:   ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, MS ELSIE COLEMAN.
