Parliament, Sunday, 05 August 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Mr Francois Beukman, has expressed his concern after he conducted an unannounced surprise visit to the Macassar Police Station in the Western Cape on Saturday night, 4 August 2018. The visit follows representations from the Macassar Safety Forum on the shortage of police resources in the Macassar-area near Khayelitsha. The availability of sufficient Saps members and vehicles to conduct patrol service and visible policing during peak times on weekends is critical to sustain effective policing. “I am very concerned about the state of affairs I witnessed on Saturday evening,” Mr Beukman said. The concerns expressed by community members on Saturday-evening about the availability of police response vehicles and response times to attend to complaints in high crime areas is valid, and needs to be addressed by police management. Beukman said five concerns were identified during the visit: The back-to basics strategy of Saps management demands effective visible policing. Lack of visibility will mean that high crime areas will not be stabilised. “It is essential that efforts should be made to increase the number of reservists in high priority areas, and encourage greater involvement of neighbourhood watches and patrollers,” Mr Beukman suggested. Mr Beukman praised the officers who were on duty on Saturday-evening for their hard work and dedication, and their continued commitment despite challenges they are operating under.
