Parliament, Wednesday, 15 August 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Economic Development will tomorrow, Thursday, 16 August 2018, continue on day 4 of its week-long oversight in the North West Province. The committee has in the past identified the tourism sector as a point of oversight interest. The sector is at the centre of the South African economic policy regime and has been identified as a key job driver in both the National Growth and Industrial Policy action plans. Previous briefings received by the committee have revealed serious competition and transformation-related challenges, which has made it difficult for smaller players to enter and thrive in the sector. While the committee seeks to deal with these issues through the Competition Amendment Bill [B 23—2018], it has identified big projects, such as Sun City amongst others, as means to assess market dominance and influence in the region and province. The committee will tomorrow meet at the Madikwe Game Reserve where it will be briefed by the North West Tourism Parks board on a business model in which communities are active owners of three high-end lodges in the reserve. Details of the oversight visit for day 2 are as follows: Date: Thursday, 16 August 2018
