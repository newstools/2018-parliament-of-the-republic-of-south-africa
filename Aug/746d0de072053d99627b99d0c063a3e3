Parliament, Saturday, 4 August 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Arts and Culture, Ms Xoliswa Tom, is saddened by the death of the legendary playwright and actor, Mr Winston Ntshona. “The creative industry is poorer today without Mr Ntshona who raised the country’s flag high on the global stage. He left an indelible mark in the industry and will be remembered for his excellent work, including raising awareness on the injustices in South Africa during the dark days of apartheid,” said Ms Tom. Mr Ntshona’s immense contribution to the liberation struggle, using art to expose the evils and atrocities of the apartheid system, is well documented. His love for the youth was shown in the way he trained and mentored young actors. Ms Tom, on behalf of the committee, has joined the nation in extendeding heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and the creative industry.
