Parliament, Tuesday, 21 August 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs has condemned the behaviour of KwaMhlanga residents who obstructed it (committee) from doing its work with the contempt it deserves. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Richard Mdakane, said such behaviour is regrettable as the Bill is intended to make better customary initiation. “What happened in KwaMhlanga does not contribute to the kind of society and responsible citizenship we want. We condemn it with the contempt it deserves. When people seek to obstruct other people’s right to participate in a parliamentary programme, that is unlawful. Mpumalanga public hearings into the Customary Initiation Bill grounded to a halt when chaos broke at KwaMhlanga, when some people sought to refuse women from participating in the public hearings, complaining that permission had not been sought from the local chief. “How this occurred is repressive, disorderly and perpetuates discrimination against women. We accept the tradition is secret and the committee is not taking that away. The Bill is a proposed law and everyone is allowed to have an input.” The ongoing Gauteng leg of the public hearings was a success and did not experience similar challenges.
