Parliament, Wednesday, 22 August 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and Training has spoken out against tender fraud at universities. The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Connie September, said the committee was not happy with the state of governance at tertiary institutions, but is pleased the minister has made a commitment to doing something about it. “There are a lot of things that threaten learning at universities and colleges. The committee will work collectively with other colleagues like the Portfolio Committee on Police to root out these elements in the sector,” Ms September said. “We must also appeal that where tender fraud and corruption rears their heads, the department must do something,” she said. The Director-General (DG) of the Department of Higher Education and Training had earlier pleaded with the committee to intervene to curb corrupt activities, which he said put institutions and vice chancellors at risk. The DG indicated that money that would otherwise have been used on creative programmes is budgeted for security. Ms September said it was crucial that all tertiary education stakeholders discuss these things together. The committee will also conduct oversight to assess the situation.
