Parliament, Tuesday, 21 August 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs today decided to call for public comments on the shortlisted candidates for possible appointment to serve as commissioners on the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC). The decision was taken to enable a participatory process in line with the strategic objectives of the fifth Parliament, to achieve a public participation-led parliament. The process follows an interview process by a panel led by the Chief Justice, as per Section 6 of the Electoral Commission Act. Eight candidates were recommended. “Following the recommendation by the panel led by the Chief Justice, the committee considers it prudent to allow members of the public to make inputs that might influence the committee’s recommendations. The IEC is at the centre of South Africa’s democratic dispensation and it is only logical to include South Africans, so their voices are heard,” said Mr Hlomani Chauke, the Chairperson of the committee. Furthermore, the decision is intended to find consensus on the final candidates among South Africans, especially for an important institution such as the IEC. Any individual or organisation has until Friday, 24 August 2018 to make such a submission to emathonsi@parliament.gov.za The eight shortlisted candidates are: ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HOME AFFAIRS, MR HLOMANI CHAUKE For media enquiries or interviews with the Chairperson, please contact the committee’s Media Officer: Name: Malatswa Molepo (Mr)
