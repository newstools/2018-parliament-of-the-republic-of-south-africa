Parliament, Thursday, 30 August 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs will tomorrow visit Fireblade Aviation in Gauteng on a fact finding mission on the private terminal saga. The Committee had earlier this year resolved to visit the company to get all the facts around the issue. At the centre of the visit is the desire to assess the desirability of privatising some immigration services at OR Tambo International Airport and to assess if this will be the most effective way of spending state resources towards achieving a capable and inclusive state as well as assessing the value add of the supposed contract. Following the meeting, the committee will do an in-loco visit to the Desmond Tutu Refugee Reception Centre in Marabastad to assess the functionality of the recently installed automated system and to interact with asylum seekers to assess if there has been an improvement in services.
