Parliament, Thursday, 16 August 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Labour has welcomed a commitment by Makro to phase out the outsourcing of staff and directly employ all workers currently employed through labour brokers. Today the committee conducted oversight visit to the wholesaler’s Bloemfontein store in the Free State where management explained plans to end the outsourcing of staff. The store employs 180 permanent staff and a process to convert the employment of 265 staff members outsourced through labour brokers is expected to start next month. The committee also emphasised the importance of employing more women in all levels, especially in management, saying this will contribute to women empowerment and in addressing the challenge of unemployment as women constitute a majority of the population. The committee also conducted oversight in the construction industry to look into issues of compliance with several labour legislations, which include Health and Safety, Conditions of Employment, Labour Relations and other related laws.
