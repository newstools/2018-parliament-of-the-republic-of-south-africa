Parliament, Thursday, 16 August 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Water and Sanitation will tomorrow visit the Sedibeng District Municipality to get answers to reports of sewage spillage into the Rietspruit stream leading to contamination of the Vaal River system. This is a follow-up meeting with the district and Emfuleni Local Municipality, as the committee visited the area in 2015 and made recommendations of interventions to findings it made. Some of the findings included inadequate infrastructure to cope with development, non-compliant effluent from the waste-water treatment works in Rietspruit, as well as ageing infrastructure. The committee will request updates on any action taken since its last visit. “It is unacceptable that since the visit by the committee, there have been constant media reports of continuing challenges in the district about contamination of the source of water feeding Gauteng province. The committee hopes to get answers from all relevant stakeholders, including provincial and national government on interventions implemented to resolve the matter,” said Mr Mlungisi Johnson, the Chairperson of the committee.
