Parliament, Thursday, 30 August 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Water and Sanitation welcomes the gradual return of water to sections of City of Johannesburg following the explosion of Eikenhof substation which supplies power to the city’s water infrastructure. “The cut in water supply has an obvious social and economic impact and is undesirable at all times. It is even more worrying when it happens in Johannesburg which is the economic hub of not only South Africa but the African continent,” said Mr Mlungisi Johnson, the Chairperson of the committee. The committee is concerned that the explosion is suspected to have been as a result of sabotage. The Committee reiterates a call it made in 2014 that there is a need for a cooperative effort to deal with issues of vandalism and theft of infrastructure in the country. Furthermore, the department must look into declaring water infrastructure national key points as per the National Key Points Act. Also, the committee made a call then for the municipality and Rand Water to find alternative sources of power to feed pump stations in cases such as this. The initiated investigation into the cause of the explosion must be urgently completed and preventative measures must be implemented to avert similar incidents in the future.
