Parliament, Wednesday, 22 August 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Tourism today welcomed the presentation by the Department of Tourism on the bilateral and multilateral engagements on tourism. Currently, there are memorandums of understanding (MoUs) signed between South Africa and 25 other countries – and a further eight which are being negotiated. These MOUs take a number of years to be finalised. The Chairperson of the Tourism Committee, Ms Lusizo Sharon Makhubela-Mashele, said: “There are definitely advantages for these MOUs as they promote tourism not only in South Africa but in the Southern African Development Community region, promoting heritage and cultural tourism, sharing best practices in tourism and the promotion of sector skills development such as language training. One of the best practices is the South Africa/Seychelles training of 20 chefs, which has resulted in Seychelles providing permanent employment to five young chefs. The committee also heard that the Regional Tourism Organisation of Southern Africa (RETOSA) will be dissolved due to governance issues and non-payment of membership fees by some member countries. The work of RETOSA will now be incorporated as a work stream of the Southern African Development Community Secretariat. Ms Makhubela-Mashele said the Department of Tourism must continue to pursue its strategic alliances with regional and global partners, as tourism remains the key driver for the creation of labour-intensive jobs and local economic development.
