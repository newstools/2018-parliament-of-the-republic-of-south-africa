Parliament, Tuesday, 06 August 2018 – The Chairpersons of Parliament’s education committees have expressed their concern regarding this morning’s accident in which 72 learners were injured when a school bus in which they were travelling overturned in Centocow, near Underberg in KwaZulu-Natal. This follows yesterday’s taxi accident, in which 21 learners were injured in Carletonville, Gauteng.
	
	Basic Education Portfolio Committee Chairperson Ms Bongiwe Mbingo-Gigaba said it is worrying that so many learners have been injured while on the way to school. “Although the details of the accident are still unclear, we are worried when our children don’t arrive safely at school.”
	
	According to media reports, in today’s accident two children are in a critical condition, while 70 others sustained minor or moderate injuries. All the children are receiving treatment for their injuries.
	
	“Scholar transport, either private or provided by authorities, should be safe and secure for our children. This is horrific. Parents send their children to school in the morning and expect them to arrive there safely. We urge the authorities to investigate the matter thoroughly,” reiterated Ms Mbingo-Gigaba.
	
	The Chairperson of the Select Committee on Education and Technology, Sports and Arts and Culture, Mr Mamagase Nchabeleng, said that the need to find solutions to the challenges associated with learner transport remains high on the committees’ agenda, especially in rural areas where dangerous terrain is a major concern.
