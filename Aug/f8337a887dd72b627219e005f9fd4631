Parliament, Wednesday, 8 August 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources, Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, has expressed mixed feelings about the latest developments with regards to former employees of Aurora mine. Mr Luzipo said although it is worth celebrating that 300 employees will finally get their long-overdue salaries, it is also demoralising to note that the majority of workers will not be paid, as their claims were unsuccessful. About 5 300 employees worked for Aurora mine before it was run down by greedy directors and eventually liquidated in October 2010. Even more disheartening, Mr Luzipo said, is the fact that, since 2010, many employees have died without justice being done.
