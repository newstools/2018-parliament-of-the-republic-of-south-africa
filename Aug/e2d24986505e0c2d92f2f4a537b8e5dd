Parliament, Tuesday, 7 August 2018 – The Select Committee on Economic Development has, today adopted the National Minimum Wage Bill, and the related pieces of legislation. The Chairperson of the Committee, Mr Mandla Rayi, said the committee was happy that the country is making such a progressive step. “All these efforts are geared to alleviating poverty and fighting inequality. It is even comforting that even opposition parties agree with the spirit of the bill, although they have raised areas of concerns,” Mr Rayi said. The Bill will be tabled in the National Council of Provinces for debate, and thereafter it will go to the President.
