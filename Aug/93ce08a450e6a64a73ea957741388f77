Parliament, Tuesday, 28 August 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has welcomed the report presented by the State Information Technology Agency (Sita) on the forensic investigations on the Rofin which also include Forensic Data Analysts and Fundudzi contracts. Scopa has noted the action taken internally by Sita and action taken on referring some matters to the South African Police Service (SAPS). The committee is happy that steps have been taken against employees that were implicated. The committee was informed today that there are about 20 employees from Sita who have been dismissed, 26 resignations, four final written warnings, six disciplinary hearings in progress, six mutual separations, three charges drafted that have not been served yet and one investigation being finalised. The committee is encouraged that there is movement towards stabilising Sita and cleaning out the rot at the agency. The committee has requested Sita to give Scopa the list of cases that have been opened with the police and Sita must meet with the police and Ipid (Independent Police Investigative Directorate) to process the Bouwman report on possible criminal cases to be opened. The committee has requested this report by the end of September 2018. ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SCOPA, MR THEMBA GODI.
