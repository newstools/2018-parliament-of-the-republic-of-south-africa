Parliament, Monday, 18 June 2018 – In response to a Constitutional Court judgment that nullified the 2014 Restitution of Land Rights Act, citing inadequate public involvement, the Portfolio Committee on Rural Development and Land Reform is making sure that as much citizens as possible get an opportunity to make an input on the redrafted Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Bill. This week the committee kick-starts extensive nationwide public hearings on the Bill that seeks to reopen the period for lodging land claims after the 1998 cut-off date, which research found that left many citizens out of the land restitution programme. Details of the Public hearings in the Northern Cape Date: Monday 18 June 2018
