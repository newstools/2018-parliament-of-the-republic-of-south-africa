Parliament, Thursday, 28 June 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Police has noted the recent spate of violence across the country, including armed robberies and the murders of two members of the South African Police Service (Saps) and of young children from the Cape Flats in the Western Cape; the murders in shopping malls and on farms; as well as taxi violence-related deaths. The committee notes that illegal firearms and dangerous weapons were used in these acts of violence. “We call on the Saps to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes are brought to book. We also want to reiterate our call on the Special Unit of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation to redouble efforts to trace and combat illegal weapons,” said the Chairperson of the committee, Mr Francois Beukman. The committee also notes conflicting media reports on the position of the Gauteng Police Commissioner. The committee calls on Saps management to ensure that the relevant prescripts contained in Section 207 of the Constitution, regarding the control of the police service, are adhered to. Mr Beukman said there are clear guidelines on the steps to follow when a provincial Commissioner loses confidence of the provincial executive. The committee will invite the National Commissioner to Parliament in August for a briefing on the status of the Saps’ restructuring plans, proposed changes to the Saps’ top management structure, and plans to boost the quality of station management in underperforming stations. The relevant unions will also be invited to the meeting.
