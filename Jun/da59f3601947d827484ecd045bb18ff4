Parliament, Thursday, 14 June 2018 – The Ad Hoc Committee to Inquire into the Intervention in the North West Provincial Government in terms of section 100 of the Constitution, today received the first progress report from the Inter-Ministerial Task Team, about the state of affairs in that province. The committee welcomed the report and said it provided a better understanding of the situation in the North West and hoped to work with all parties involved to restore good governance and sound financial management and accountability in the province. On the 27th of June, the committee will engage with the Acting Premier of North West and MECs of the five departments that are under section 100 (1) (b) of the Constitution. The committee will also invite the National Treasury to give a diagnostic analysis of the fiscal position of the province as well as the Auditor-General’s office from North West for an in-depth analysis and to give findings on the North West province. The Chairperson of the committee Mr Charel de Beer called for good communication between the Inter-Ministerial Task Team and the leadership in the province for the intervention to be effective. “What they did was excellent to immediately engage with the provincial legislature and the executive, and we advise that when irregularities are discovered, report them to the law-enforcements agencies immediately, so that the investigations run parallel with the intervention, unlike in Limpopo where it was done when the intervention was about a year, it was late and it delayed the process of consequence management,” the Chairperson said.
