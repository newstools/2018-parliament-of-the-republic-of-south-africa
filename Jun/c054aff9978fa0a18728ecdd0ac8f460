Parliament, Wednesday, 13 June 2018 – The Select Committee on Land and Mineral Resources has commended the Minister of the Department of Mineral Resources, Mr Gwede Mantashe, for his swift visit to the Sibanye-Stillwater mine, following the deaths on Monday of four mine workers. The committee has noted with keen interest that after meeting with mine management and organised labour, Mr Mantashe mentioned that the Department of Mineral Resources will investigate the accident and take drastic action, should this be necessary. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Olifile Sefako, urged the Minister to ensure that the investigation is conducted as a matter of urgency, with the requisite due diligence. “The deaths at the Sibanye-Stillwater mine have long passed alarming proportions and required a different approach,” said Mr Sefako. The committee has echoed the Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources, organised labour unions and other stakeholders in extending heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families.
