Parliament, Thursday, 14 June 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) today held a successful meeting with the Inter-Ministerial Task Team (IMTT) on plans to resolve the impasse between Eskom and the municipalities that owe billions in electricity debt. The committee is happy that there is something that government is doing to deal with this matter. Scopa is looking forward to a report-back from the IMTT in September. The committee has emphasised that the IMTT needs to get Eskom to stop the interruptions since the matter is being given priority attention. This is so that ordinary South Africans can have peace of mind with the knowledge that Parliament and government are on top of this matter. Scopa also wants to emphasise that municipalities must honour their debt and their payment arrangements. The fact that both Parliament and government are intervening does not mean that they should relax. Municipalities should also jerk up their financial management processes and systems and cut off waste of public money. Scopa hopes that by September there should be a solution to this matter.
