Parliament, Wednesday, 27 June 2018 – Public hearings hosted by the Portfolio Committee on Rural Development and Land Reform on the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Bill are well under way, with six provinces covered thus far. At each venue, large numbers of the community attended, many of them in support of reopening land claims. Some participants provided useful insights into making amendments to the bill which will ensure that equity in the distribution of land rights is achieved. Many people want their land returned to them. Then there are those who have been waiting for title deeds since 1994, others have outstanding claims that have not been paid, while still others allege there is corruption in Communal Property Associations. Once the public hearings in all provinces have been completed, the submissions will be captured and analysed for the legal drafters to prepare the first draft of the bill for consideration. The committee will have further engagements at Parliament with stakeholders, such as non-governmental organisations, trade unions and community-based organisations. Details for upcoming public hearings in Eastern Cape and Gauteng are as follows: Thursday, 28 June 2018 at 10h00 Friday, 29 June 2018 at 10h00 ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE WHIP OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND LAND REFORM, MR PUMZILE MNGUNI.
