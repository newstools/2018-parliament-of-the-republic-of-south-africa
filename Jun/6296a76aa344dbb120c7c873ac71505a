Parliament, Friday, 22 June 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Rural Development and Land Reform commenced with public hearings in Limpopo, Northern Cape, Mpumalanga and Free State provinces this week. The Bill amends the Restitution Act of 1994 which gives effect to section 25 (7) of the Constitution in terms of providing for equitable redress to those who were dispossessed of their land rights under the colonial and apartheid governments. This Bill, therefore, amends certain definitions, amends the cut-off date for lodgement of land claims; regulates matters related to judges of the Land Claims Court and to create certain offences. The Whip of the Portfolio Committee on Rural Development and Land Reform, Mr Pumzile Mnguni, has indicated that the committee is satisfied with the turnout and the varied inputs the committee has received thus far.
