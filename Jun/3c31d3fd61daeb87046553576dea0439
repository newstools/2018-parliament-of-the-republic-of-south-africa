Parliament, Thursday, 28 June 2018 – A delegation of the Joint Constitutional Review Committee has applauded the quality of debate heard during public hearings in Marble Hall, Limpopo. The committee is currently holding extensive hearings around the country to hear people’s views on whether a review of Section 25 of the Constitution and other clauses are necessary, to make it possible for the state to expropriate land in the public interest without compensation, and propose constitutional amendments where necessary. “We are encouraged by the level of arguments that have been advanced and we are hopeful that the standard set here will be carried through the entire six-week process,” said Mr Vincent Smith, the Co-Chairperson of the Committee. The delegation further applauded the tolerance displayed by members of the public during the hearings. “Land remains an emotive issue, but the level of tolerance exhibited in Marble Hall is commendable, and give life to the provisions of the freedom of opinion and expression enshrined in the Bill of Rights,” Mr Smith emphasised. The large turnout of over 1 000 people at the Marble Hall hearings is also noteworthy, as the delegation was only expecting around 300 to 350 participants. The delegation continues with public hearings in Mokopane today.
