Parliament, Sunday, 10 June 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Police will focus on 7 priorities during the public hearing on the current spate of cash-in-transit heists that will take place this coming Wednesday, 13 June 2018 in Parliament. The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Francois Beukman said that the aim of the public hearing is to bring all role-players in the cash-in-transit industry, especially in the security and law enforcement environment, under one roof and ascertain whether sufficient short-term and long term measures are in place to deal with the current scourge of cash- in -transit heists. “Cash-in-transit heists directly affect the safety of security officers, the SAPS and members of the public and the general perception of safety in the Republic and the Portfolio Committee needs assurances of the role players that the necessary pro-active steps are in place to deal with the current challenges,” Mr Beukman said.
