Parliament, Wednesday, 20 June 2018 – The Select Committee on International Relations and Trade today received a presentation on the Annual Performance Plan for 2018-2019 from South African Tourism (SAT). The presentation was welcomed by the committee, as it gave context to the challenges facing SAT in the global arena to market South Africa as a safe destination. SAT has the potential and vigour, the committee believes, to promote South Africa internationally and locally. South Africa is the number-one country for business events in Africa and the Middle East, and the committee urged SAT to maintain this position in the year ahead as business-event tourists spend six times more than leisure travellers. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Eddie Makue said: “SAT should look at engaging with the provincial tourism authorities to focus more on the development of rural, cultural, sport and township tourism.” Apart from the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga, provinces need to do more to highlight and package their destinations to attract tourists. One of the key focus areas for SAT should be grading accommodation, the committee said, as grading improves the quality of offerings and thus improves tourism overall. The committee also welcomed the development of new domestic management companies and tour operators who will focus on domestic tourism.
