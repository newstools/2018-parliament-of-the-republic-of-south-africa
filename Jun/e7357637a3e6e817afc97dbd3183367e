Parliament, Wednesday, 6 June 2018 – A meeting of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) to discuss deviations and expansions in the Department of Water and Sanitation has been adjourned until 2 o’clock (14H00) for the department to prepare detailed answers to questions by Members of Parliament this morning. Scopa wants to know why the department continued with deviations that were not approved by the National Treasury. “If you ask for permission and it is declined, and you still go ahead nonetheless, what is the point of asking for permission in the first place?” Scopa Chairperson Mr Themba Godi asked the department’s officials. When the department struggled to provide clear answers, Scopa resolved to adjourn the meeting to give the officials time to prepare. The meeting will continue at 14h00 at venue: V454.
