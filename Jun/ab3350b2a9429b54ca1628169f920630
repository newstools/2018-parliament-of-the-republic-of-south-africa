Parliament, Thursday, 21 June 2018 – Committee Chairperson, Ms Lungi Mnganga-Gcabashe has called on Eskom management and the three trade unions involved (NUM, NUMSA and Solidarity) to find an agreeable solution that will guarantee the long term sustainability of Eskom. “We appreciate the intervention by the Minister of Public Enterprises which effectively enabled the parties to reopen the negotiations. We are also hopeful that the facilitation role played by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) – a trusted and experienced body in the negotiations – will make it possible for the parties to find one another,” said Ms Mnganga-Gcabashe While we appreciate the right of organised workers represented by their recognised unions and management to bargain on salaries and benefits to Eskom workers; we wish to appeal to all the parties to the collective bargaining process to seek to find amicable solutions. We trust that all the parties understand fully the grave implications to our economy and society of instability at Eskom. “Our people desperately need electricity services, especially now in the middle of winter at affordable prices. We call on all patriotic South Africans to ensure the success of the negotiations for the sake of our economy and our people, particularly the working class and the poor,” said Ms Mnganga-Gcabashe. The intervention by government to appoint a new board and executive management, as well as the action that has been taken by Eskom against some managers suspected of being complicit in corruption and maladministration, have given hope to South Africans that significant work is being done to turn around the fortunes of Eskom.
