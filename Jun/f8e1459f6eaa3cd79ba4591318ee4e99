Parliament, Friday, 15 June 2018 – The Select Committee on Security and Justice has applauded the work of the Magistrates Commission, following the adoption of seven committee reports by the National Council of Provinces (NCOP).
	
	All the reports entailed the work of the commission which was presented to the committee by the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Mr Michael Masutha.
	
	“Although we always held the commission in the highest esteem, our view is that the NCOP has put its stamp of approval to its sterling work. Parliament will stop at nothing in its commitment to ensure that justice is not just done, but is also seen to be done. This is universal across all and sundry, irrespective of a position held by a person found to be in conflict with the law,” said Mr George Mthimunye, the Chairperson of the committee.
	
	Four of the reports recommended withholding of remunerations of the Chief Magistrate in Kempton Park, Additional Magistrate in Randburg, Acting Additional Magistrate in George and Aspirant Additional Magistrate in Delmas.
	
	The other three dealt with suspension and provisional suspension from office of the Chief Magistrate in Bloemfontein, Magistrate in Lichtenburg and Acting Additional Magistrate in George.
	
	Mr Mthimunye has thanked members of the committee who are delegates from different provinces and political parties represented in the NCOP for their diligent work during engagements with the Minister.
