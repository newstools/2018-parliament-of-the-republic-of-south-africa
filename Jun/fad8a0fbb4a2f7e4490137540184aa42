Parliament, Wednesday, 20 June 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Transport has noted with deep sadness the passing of one of its members, Mr Sibusiso Radebe. The committee Chairperson, Ms Dikeledi Magadzi, said Sbu’s youthfulness and courage always showed in the committee deliberations. “Sbu was a driven young member who had a bright future in Parliament. The committee has lost this giant young person and it is hurting. The committee will surely miss his aggressive but frank style of engaging,” Ms Magadzi said. “He was fearless and always saw life and his work in a positive way. I am surely speaking on behalf of the committee when I say South Africa has lost, death has robbed Parliament again.” Media reports indicated on Wednesday (19 June) morning that Mr Radebe was killed in Gauteng, although he is originally from Mpumalanga. Ms Magadzi called on law enforcement agencies to ensure that the perpetrators of this heinous crime are brought to book. “We want our people to live in a peaceful country where the lives of all individuals are appreciated. Each time a person is killed in this manner, South Africa loses in one way or another.” She said committee deliberations will never be the same without Sbu’s participation. The committee sends its heartfelt condolences to the bereaved Radebe family and relatives, Sbu’s friends and his organisation, the African National Congress.
