Parliament, June, 07 June 2018 – The Standing Committee on Finance has reaffirmed its 6 June statement on Mr Floyd Shivambu’s behaviour, including that he questioned on racial grounds the presence of National Treasury Deputy Director-General Mr Ismail Momoniat at the committee meeting. The committee further notes that Mr Shivambu alleged that Mr Momoniat is undermining African leadership. Neither the committee statement nor the Chairperson said that Mr Shivambu did not want Mr Momoniat to speak at the meeting because he is of Indian origin. The committee recommends that if Mr Shivambu believes that the committee’s statement does not reflect his behaviour at the 6 June meeting, he should take the matter further with the appropriate authorities in Parliament and outside. The committee reiterates its call for National Treasury to ensure that its senior officials are more representative of South Africa’s racial and gender demographics and also for the entire financial sector to be more demographically representative. The chairperson has responded in writing to Mr Shivambu’s suggestion that his participation in international conferences is funded by Mr Momoniat. The correspondence is enclosed.
