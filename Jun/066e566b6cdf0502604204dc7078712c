Parliament, Friday, 8 June 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Sport and Recreation wishes the Springboks well in their rugby test match against England on Saturday. The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane, said the committee is satisfied with the composition of the match-day team, as well as the Springbok squad. “Judging by this team, it is clear transformation is being realised and that excites the committee. The selections are all meritorious and all of them are capped by a Springbok captain who is black, for the first time in history,” Ms Dlulane said. She said although race is an important discussion, in this day and age South Africans should not obsess about the race of who leads the Springboks. “The reality is that before too long, the Springboks will be truly representative of our demographics. The system is able to produce athletes who are competent across racial lines. All that is needed is to give them opportunities,” she said. The committee is excited at the opportunity given to Mr Siya Kolisi, Ms Dlulane said, and is sure that he will make good use of it. South Africa plays England in the first of three tests tomorrow in Johannesburg.
