Parliament, Tuesday, 19 February 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services today agreed to postponed the discussion on its draft report on the request to expedite procedures to remove the Public Protector from office by a week, so that members have adequate time to peruse the draft report. Committee Chairperson Ms Madipoane Mothapo informed the meeting that she received a request from some committee members asking to postpone the meeting, as they were only informed of the agenda yesterday and had not seen the report. The committee agreed that the draft report would be sent to committee members in the next 24 hours, at the latest, so they can prepare for the committee’s engagement on Tuesday, 26 February 2019. The committee further agreed that it would receive a status report briefing from the Ministry on 27 February 2019 on all the contracts the Ministry has with Bosasa. All members agreed that this matter is urgent, particularly in light of reports about Bosasa’s liquidation and the services Bosasa provides in South Africa’s correctional facilities. The committee also plans to deal with the Traditional Courts Bill in March 2019.
