Parliament, 21 February 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources has resolved, in principle, to institute a full-scale inquiry into allegations of state capture levelled against Minister Mosebenzi Zwane. This decision was taken after the Committee held an incomplete question-and-answer session with the Minister in October 2017. Mr Zwane was then invited to return at a later date. The Chairperson of the Committee, Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, said: “The Committee could no longer entertain further postponements from the Minister and took a decision to institute an inquiry. Members had outstanding questions from the initial Q&A session and they now reserve their right to ask them during the inquiry,” said Mr Luzipo.
