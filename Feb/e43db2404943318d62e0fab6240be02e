Parliament, Tuesday, 27 February 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Commutations has undertaken to begin a process of removing Mr Rubben Mohlaloga as a member and Chairperson of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa). Subsequent to his appointment as Chairperson in December 2017, Mr Mohlaloga was later found guilty of fraud and money laundering by the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crime Court on 15 January 2018. “Out of respect of the rule of natural justice, the Committee will inform him about the decision and give him five working days to explain why he should not be removed from Icasa,” said Mr Humphrey Maxegwana, the Chairperson of the Committee. The process will be instituted in terms of Section 8 of the Icasa Act No. 13 of 2000.
