Parliament, Wednesday, 28 February 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Science and Technology today deliberated on the National Research Foundation Amendment Bill, which seeks to provide for the promotion of research and human capacity development in the various fields of science and technology, including in the humanities, social sciences and indigenous knowledge. Further, the Bill seeks to provide for the establishment of a National Research Foundation to support, advance and promote science engagement; to develop, support and maintain national research facilities; to promote the development and maintenance of the national science system; and support of government priorities, among other things. The Chairperson of the Committee, Ms Lindiwe Maseko, said: “At the public hearing held on 21 February 2018, the Committee reflected that consideration of the current amendment clauses, which speak to the structure of the Foundation, may require additional consideration of provisions in the principal Act that are not currently open to consideration within the scope of the Bill.” Today’s deliberations took the Committee a step further and the Committee will now await the decision from the House to proceed with the proposed amendments.
