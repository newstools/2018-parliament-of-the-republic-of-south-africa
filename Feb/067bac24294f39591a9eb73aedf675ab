Parliament, Thursday, 21 February 2018 – The Ad Hoc Committee to Amend Section 25 of the Constitution today received a presentation from the Parliamentary Legal Services on the legislative process to amend Chapter 2 of the Constitution to allow for the expropriation of land in the public interest without compensation. Committee Chairperson Ms Thoko Didiza said the committee was mandated to draft the necessary amendment by the National Assembly on 6 December 2018. The committee heard that in developing a policy in terms of Rule 274 of the NA, among other things, it would have to indicate which subsections should be amended, expanded or deleted. The committee will further have to develop a Bill. As the Bill will be a Section 74 Bill, legal services suggested that it be sent to the National House of Traditional leaders, the public and provincial legislatures for comment. The committee also, in principal, adopted its programme for this process. It includes a presentation on the summary of the Joint Constitutional Review Committee report as well as presentations from various experts on the question of land reform. Members of the committee were request by Ms Didiza to identify experts on this matter, so that the committee can finalise a list of them.
