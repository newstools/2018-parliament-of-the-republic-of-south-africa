Parliament, Monday, 04 February 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education today expressed her condolences to the families of all the learners that died in the Hoërskool Driehoek disaster after a bridge connecting two blocks of the school building collapsed. Committee Chairperson, Ms Nomalungelo Gina, said the committee is saddened by the events that led to the loss of young lives. “It is never easy for a parent to lose a child. Parents send their kids to school in the morning and expect them to return safe and unharmed. This is a dreadful, terrible accident. We feel the pain of the parents.” Three learners died on Friday when the wall collapsed. A fourth learner died on Sunday due to injuries sustained in the tragedy. Twenty learners remain in hospital after a bridge connecting two blocks of the school buildings collapsed on Friday morning. Ms Gina said the committee expressed its heartfelt condolences to all the families, friends and the school community. “We need to stand together during this difficult time.” ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON BASIC EDUCATION, MS NOMALUNGELO GINA.
