Parliament, Tuesday, 27 February 2018Â  The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Mr Francois Beukman, is saddened by the passing of the three police officers, attached to the North West Tracing Team, just outside eNgcobo. The passing of these officers robs the South African Police Services of the dedicated officials that are on a daily basis faced with danger while protecting our people. It is sad that these officials passed on the course of performing their duty. Our thoughts and prayers are with their familes at this difficult time," said Mr Beukman.
