Parliament, Wednesday, 28 February 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has instructed the Board of the State Information Technology Agency (Sita) to report back to Scopa within 14 days on the process of cancelling the Forensic Data Analysts (FDA) contract. Scopa is appalled that a sole company owned by an ex-policeman can hold the whole country to ransom by threatening the collapse of the criminal justice system if the state cancels this contract. This power should reside with the state, not an individual. The Committee has noted the assurance by the head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), Mr Robert McBride, that the investigation into the FDA matter is at an advanced stage. Scopa is looking forward to the conclusion of this investigation and has requested the National Treasury to provide it with the reasons given by the South African Police Service (SAPS) when it requested deviations for the FDA contract. Scopa has requested Sita to forward to the Committee the legal advice and interpretation of that advice it received from their counsel that led to the agency paying FDA, even after it was advised against doing so by Parliament. The Committee has also welcomed the assurance from the National Commissioner of Police, General Kehla Sithole, that SAPS will work with Ipid and provide all relevant information needed by Ipid to conduct its work, particularly in the cases of Captain Morris Tshabalala and Lt General Richard Mdluli.
