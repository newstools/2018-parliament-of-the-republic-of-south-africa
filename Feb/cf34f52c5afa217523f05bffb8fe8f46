Parliament, Tuesday, 20 February 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has resolved to call the Minister of Police, Mr Fikile Mbalula, the South African Police Service (SAPS), the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and the State Information Technology Agency (Sita) to appear before it. Scopa will this afternoon send letters to SAPS and Sita to offer them a right of reply to allegations made against them in an Ipid presentation today. Scopa also wants to know whether Sita has continued making payments to the Forensic Data Analysts maintenance and support contract, after Parliament last year requested Sita to stop making payments to that contract, as doing so is illegal and irregular. The Committee has also requested Ipid to furnish members of Scopa with the ongoing correspondence between Ipid and the National Commissioner of SAPS regarding requests for declassification of crucial information in several investigations. Ipid informed Scopa today that it is struggling with several cases due to SAPS refusing to declassify information. These cases include the case of Captain Morris “KGB” Tshabalala who was employed at SAPS while he was a wanted criminal. Ipid has also been struggling since 2012 to get information declassified in the case of General Richard Mdluli. The Committee has also committed to follow up on why Ipid is struggling to find funding for the Marikana investigation, as recommended by the Farlam Commission.
