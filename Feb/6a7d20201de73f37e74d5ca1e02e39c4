Parliament, Tuesday, 27 February 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries today received presentations from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the Department of Trade and Industry on the poultry situation. The Committee notes the R1 billion agro-processing incentive launched by the Department of Trade and Industry for the benefit of poultry producers. However, the Committee Chairperson, Ms Rosina Semenya, asked how this incentive will assist those poultry farmers severely affected by avian flu and the drought. Farmers also need to be made aware of how they can apply to receive funding. The Department of Trade and Industry reported that South Africa imports about 90% of mechanically deboned meat (MDM) and plans to undertake research into the viability of investment in MDM plants to increase the capability of producing our own MDM meat. The Committee expected a report on job losses and closure of some poultry farms, however the interdepartmental task team is still gathering this information and will report to the Committee. The Committee is worried about the speed of the two departments’ work to save jobs and mandates them to work speedily and provide feedback to the Committee. The Committee would also like an update on the acquisition of distressed poultry farms, some of which have since closed, particularly in eThekwini municipality.
