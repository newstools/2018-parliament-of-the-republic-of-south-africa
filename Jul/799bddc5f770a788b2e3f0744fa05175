Parliament, Monday, 23 July 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises, Ms Lungi Mnganga-Gcabashe, has expressed concern after Eskom announced irregular expenditure amounting to R19 billion. The power utility released its 2017/18 financial results today, in which it reported a 44% increase in municipal debt amounting to R4.2 billion and a loss of R2.3 billion. Ms Mnganga-Gcabashe said the committee will continue to engage with Eskom to address its challenges and restore public and investor confidence. “The power utility has in the past months come under scrutiny because of the financial and operational performance it experienced,” said Ms Mnganga-Gcabashe. “The committee will make time in its programme to invite Eskom, so that members are briefed on the latest financial results”.
