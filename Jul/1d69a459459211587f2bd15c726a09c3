Parliament, Wednesday, 18 July 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Mr Francois Beukman, has called for intensified intelligence gathering backed by proactive interventions to deal with the increasing number of hoax bomb threats, mainly in KwaZulu-Natal. “Crime intelligence has to play a greater strategic role if this trend is to be curtailed. It is unacceptable that the people of South Africa are prevented from living their daily lives because of these threats. The South African Police Service (Saps) must ensure that people go about their daily chores without fear,” Mr Beukman said. The committee also calls on members of the community to work with Saps and provide information so that these threats are stopped. The committee will, on resumption of Parliament’s term in August, invite the Saps to give a detailed briefing on the bomb threats, as well as an update on various cases occurring in mosques around the country. The committee has called for speedy resolution of these cases.
