Parliament, Monday, 23 July 2018 – A delegation of the Joint Constitutional Review Committee today held public hearings into a possible review of section 25 of the Constitution, at the Mthatha Town Hall. The committee has again listened to various inputs from a number of people, who included representatives from a number of political parties, civic organisations and traditional leaders. The Co-Chairperson of the committee, Mr Lewis Nzimande, commended the way people who attended the hearings were orderly. “The committee is pleased with the attendance of the hearings which saw more than the expected number of people filling up the venue. We were over-subscribed as usual but we managed to give almost everyone who wanted to talk the opportunity to talk,” said Mr Nzimande. The committee is scheduled to hold the next public hearings for the Eastern Cape Province leg at the Queenstown Town Hall on Wednesday, 25 July 2018.
