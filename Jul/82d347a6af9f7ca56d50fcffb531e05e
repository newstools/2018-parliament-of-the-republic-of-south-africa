Parliament,Monday, 16 July 2018 – The Chairperson of the PortfolioCommittee on Mineral Resources, Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, and the Chairperson of theSelect Committee on Land and Mineral Resources, Mr Olifile Sefako, have learnedwith shock about the deaths of six mine workers at Phalaborwa Mining Company inLimpopo. On behalf of their committees, Mr Luzipo and Mr Sefako extendheartfelt condolences to the families and colleagues of the deceased workers. “The issue of mine healthand safety has long reached a crisis proportions and requires desperateintervention. The Department of Mineral Resources must urgently draftlegislation that will hold mine bosses and managers accountable for any lifelost on duty,” said Mr Luzipo. Mr Luzipo believes that it is highlyabnormal that 18 lives have been lost in just three mine accidents in threemonths. It is in this context that the Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resourceshas written a letter to Minister Gwede Mantashe, to seek clarity on the statusof the Mine Health and Safety Amendment Bill, as it has become an urgent pieceof legislation. The committee also wants to hear what measures the departmentis implementing in the interim. The committee will also hear by nolater than 19 July 2018 via written submissions from organised labour on how minehealth and safety can be improved. The two Chairpersons believe that ifwhat has been reported in the media about the cause of death at this mine istrue, then there has been gross negligence by those in charge and they shouldbe fired immediately. Mr Luzipo will visit the mine, as a matter of urgency.
