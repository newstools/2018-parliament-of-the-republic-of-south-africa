At the time of his death he was the dean of the faculty of health services at the University of Cape Town. On behalf of the committee, Ms Maseko sends her condolences to the family, friends, medical fraternity, Professor Mayosi’s colleagues and students at the University of Cape Town. “We wish them strength during this difficult time” said Ms Maseko.
