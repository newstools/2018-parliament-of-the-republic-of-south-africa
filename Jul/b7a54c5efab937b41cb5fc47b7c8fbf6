Parliament, Saturday, 21 July 2018 – The Joint Constitutional Review Committee (CRC) will next week move on to listen to the public in the Eastern Cape and Gauteng. On Monday a delegation will commence with public hearings in the Eastern Cape whilst the other delegation will start on Thursday in Gauteng into a possible review of section 25 of the Constitution.
	
	The committee was instructed by the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces to ascertain whether a review of section 25 of the Constitution and other clauses are necessary, to make it possible for the state to expropriate land in the public interest without compensation, and propose the necessary constitutional amendments where necessary. The committee already held hearings in the Northern Cape, Limpopo, Free State, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and the North West. Find the programme for Gauteng and the Eastern Cape below.
