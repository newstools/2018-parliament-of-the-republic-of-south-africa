Parliament, Monday, 30 July 2018 – This week the Portfolio Committee on Transport will visit three provinces, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape, to continue with public hearings on the Road Accident Benefit Scheme (Rabs) Bill. The Bill, which seeks to replace the Road Accident Fund Act and to improve the administration of benefits and payouts to accident victims, received mixed reactions from the public and members of the legal fraternity, during last week’s public hearings in North West, Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga.
