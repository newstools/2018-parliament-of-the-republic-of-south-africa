Parliament, Tuesday, 24 July 2018 – Residents of Mpumalanga province will tomorrow (Wednesday) have an opportunity to make inputs on the draft Road Accident Benefit Scheme Bill, currently before the Portfolio Committee on Transport. After meeting with the communities of North West and Gauteng provinces today, the committee will tomorrow hold public hearings on the Bill, in Emalahleni (formerly Witbank). The Bill is intended to replace the Road Accident Fund Act and to improve the administration of benefits and payouts to accident victims. It also seeks to provide for a social security scheme for the victims of road accidents and establish the Road Accident Benefit Scheme Administrator to administer and implement the scheme. Committee Chairperson, Ms Dikeledi Magadzi, said: “The Bill cannot be a complete legislation without any input and participation by the public.” Details of the public hearings in Mpumalanga are as follows: Date: Wednesday, 25 July 2018
