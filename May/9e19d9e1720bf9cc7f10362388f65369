Parliament, 15 May 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Telecommunications and Postal Services has welcomed a briefing from the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services on the Ikamva National e-Skills Institute (iNeSi) Bill, which was referred to the committee on 7 May 2018. The Minister of the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Mr Siyabonga Cwele, said that the Bill seeks to integrate the department’s three e-skills development-related components, namely the National Electronic Media Institute of South Africa (Nemisa), the e-Skills Institute (e-Si) and the Institute for Space and Software Applications “The Bill envisages the establishment of an iNeSi institute, which will act as a national catalytic collaborator, facilitator and change agent for delivering e-skills through skills development,” said Mr Cwele. The committee Chairperson, Mr Jabu Mahlangu, emphasised the importance of the briefing, saying that it was critical for the committee to have clarity from the department before it begins to process the Bill. The committee has raised concerns with a number of issues relating to the Bill, including the proposed number of board members; the iNeSi business case and funding model; the role of the Minister, board and executives; as well as collaboration with the Department of Basic Education. Mr Mahlangu outlined the process going forward, saying that the Bill will be translated into 10 other official languages and advertised in the media to invite written and oral submissions from members of the public.
