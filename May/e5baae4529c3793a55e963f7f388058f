They are Mr Louis Zeuner, Ms Ramasela Ganda, Ms Ursula Fikelepi, Mr Edward Kieswetter and Ms Dimakatso Matshoga. “Dr Molefe’s appointment is a serious attempt by the Minister to tackle corruption and to turn around Transnet to deal with the challenges the freight utility company has been battling with,” said Ms Mnganga-Gcabashe.
