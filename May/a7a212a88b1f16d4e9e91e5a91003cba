Parliament, Monday, 14 May 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Basic Education has noted with shock the brazen attack in Durban on the deputy president of the National Teachers’ Union. Committee Chairperson Ms Nomalungelo Gina said media reports regarding the alleged ambush shooting of Mr Allen Thompson must be condemned in the harshest possible terms. “It is even more concerning that after firing on Mr Thompson, the attackers allegedly followed him into the hospital in an attempt to finish what they had started. This is criminality at its worst. No stone should be left unturned in finding the culprits and bringing them to book.” According to media reports, Mr Thompson was traveling from his office in Empangeni to Durban when the alleged attack occurred on Friday afternoon. Heavily armed men allegedly fired at him, missing his head and injuring him in the shoulder. The gunmen then followed him to Netcare Umhlangla hospital and after an unsuccessful search for him, searched his car and left with two laptops that allegedly contained critical information for the investigation into education in the province, amongst others things. The attackers allegedly left his wallet and the car, even though the keys were still in the ignition. Ms Gina called on the local authorities to ensure that the alleged attackers are apprehended speedily, as they pose a danger to society.
