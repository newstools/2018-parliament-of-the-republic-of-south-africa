Parliament, Tuesday, 22 May 2018 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has lambasted the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) for circumventing supply-chain management processes when planning three events, which amounted to R4m each in KwaZulu-Natal. The committee raised concerns with the fact that the former acting Chief Executive Officer of Sassa, Ms Pearl Bhengu, speedily approved the request for these events. She did this without the three quotes required and it is apparent that prices were inflated for the services that were required. Scopa has noted the commitments made by the current acting CEO, Mr Abraham Mahlangu and the new Minister, Ms Susan Shabangu, that there will be action taken against officials where necessary and, where applicable, monies will be recovered. Scopa has also requested Mr Mahlangu to look into the matter of personal security that was offered to Ms Bhengu since 2012 and supply the amount of money that Sassa has spent on the security thus far. The committee also decided to defer questions on deviations and expansions to a later date, as it needed more time to probe the agency in the presence of National Treasury.
