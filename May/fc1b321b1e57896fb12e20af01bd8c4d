Parliament, Friday, 25 May 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Mr Francois Beukman, has called on the South African Police Service (Saps) to prioritise the investigation into the senseless killing of Captain Qeya Jonas Tshabalala in Bloemfontein. The committee would also like to extend its heartfelt condolences to Captain Tshabalala’s family and colleagues. “May they find strength during this difficult time,” Mr Beukman said. The continued senseless killing of police officers is treasonous and requires a societal response if we are to deal effectively with these worrying occurrences. Also, it is necessary for the Saps to move with speed to make information technology a pillar of its crime-fighting strategy. To this end, the committee has emphasised the need for body cameras as a tool to fight this scourge. The committee calls on the community to share information with the police to aid the investigation, in the interests of justice. Furthermore, an effective strategy to deal with the proliferation of arms, which are primary tools of crime, must be put in place and implemented urgently. The Saps management must move urgently to address the five steps proposed by the committee to deal with the proliferation of guns, namely: ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON POLICE, MR FRANCOIS BEUKMAN For media enquiries or interviews with the Chairperson, please contact the committee’s Media Officer: Name: Malatswa Molepo (Mr)
