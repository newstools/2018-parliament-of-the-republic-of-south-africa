Parliament, Friday, 25 May 2018 – The Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Auditor-General (AG), Mr Vincent Smith, is extremely concerned to hear reports of death threats against Auditor-General officials auditing the eThekwini Metropolitan municipality. The threats are a direct affront to good governance and to the spirit of the Constitution. As a Chapter 9 institution, the office of the Auditor-General is empowered to deliver its mandate without fear or favour, and is strategically positioned to ensure good governance as a precursor to efficient service delivery. “It is both unfortunate and criminal to seek to intimidate AG’s officials and prevent them from doing their work. This matter must be escalated to the relevant law-enforcement agencies for proper investigation,” Mr Smith said. Mr Smith emphasised that the threats are particularly unfortunate considering the Auditor-General’s recently released dire audit report on municipalities. The committee remains of the view that the AG’s office remains a critical stakeholder in strengthening South Africa’s fledgling democracy. The committee has called on the political leadership within the municipality to assist the AG officials to get the documentation they require to do their work. Furthermore, the South African Police Service must urgently investigate the threats made against the auditors.
