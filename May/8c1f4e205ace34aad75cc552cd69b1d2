Parliament, Thursday, 10 May 2018 – As the delegation of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa to the Pan African Parliament (PAP) we want to raise our concern over seeming lack of accountability from the re-elected President of the institution, Mr Roger Nkodo Dang. Mr Dang, who was elected to serve a second term today, dissolved the fourth Parliament of the PAP to open for the election of new office bearers without tabling his presidential report. Calls for him to return to the podium to respond to the request fell on deaf ears. We believe as a continent we cannot progress if our highest institutions are led by leaders who show such total disregard for transparency and accountability. As a country, we cannot embrace such behaviour as it flies in the face of democracy and principles of good governance. For us to build a strong Pan African Parliament, that represents the will and desires of our people, we need to put into power exemplary leaders who will follow in the great footsteps of leaders like Thomas Sankara, Oliver Tambo, Patrice Lumumba, Albertina Sisulu and Nelson Mandela. Leaders who were above reproach, and who put the people they serve above everything else. Mr Dang takes up his position again today without accounting for all the activities and monies he spent during his last term. How are we to trust his leadership when his operations are clouded in secrecy and lack of transparency. We call on other Members of the PAP to consider the precedence they are setting and legacy they want to leave by allowing this behaviour to rear its head in the running of operations of a crucial institution of the magnitude of the PAP.
