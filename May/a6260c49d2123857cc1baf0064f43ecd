Parliament, Wednesday, 20 May 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Mr Francois Beukman, welcomes the arrest of a Bellville South Community Service Centre constable relating to the theft of 18 firearms at the Bellville police station. The committee has always held the view that stricter gun control is a pillar necessary to the effective fight against violent crime. “It is thus disappointing that an officer of the law is alleged to have conspired in breaking the law and possibly aiding the perpetration of crime. The SAPS must work with the National Prosecuting Authority to ensure successful prosecution,” Mr Beukman said. This arrest confirms the committee’s considered view that the implementation of measure such as channelling more resources to the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation’s specialised unit focussing on illegal fire-arms; implementation of more projects and network operations initiated by Crime-Intelligence dealing with gun smuggling by criminal syndicates; Stricter control measures about SAPS stores; and A full-scale review of the turn-around strategy of the FCR (Fire-Arms Registry) will yield the necessary results in fighting the proliferation of illegal firearms. Furthermore, there is urgent need to implement life style audits on SAPS members to fight against any form of corruption. Vetting and life style audits can be an effective way of removing rogue officers within the system and ensure the return of the credibility of the organization. The Committee will continue to engage SAPS senior management on implementation of plans to reduce illegal firearms in the country.
