Parliament, Wednesday, 23 May 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and Training, Ms Connie September, has expressed shock at the killing of a University of Zululand (UniZulu) professor. University of Zululand’s Dean of Arts, Prof Gregory H Kamwendo was reportedly shot and killed at his Empangeni home late on Tuesday. “Academia has lost, UniZulu will never be the same without this inquisitive mind, whose only interest was to educate the African child.” Ms September said the committee was saddened and wished Prof Kamwendo’s family, colleagues, students, and the wider research community at UniZulu comfort during this sad period. “We call on law enforcements to do all they could in ensuring that the culprits and their motives for this callous act are known, and punished. “Indeed South Africa has lost,” she said.
