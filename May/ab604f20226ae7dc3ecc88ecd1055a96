Parliament, Wednesday, 02 May 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Communications will tomorrow conduct an oversight visit to the Film and Publication Board head offices in Gauteng. The FPB has recently faced leadership challenges with the agency having parted unceremoniously with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operations Officer. The Committee had highlighted reservations with the golden handshake given to the CEO despite serious allegations made against him. Also, the staff at the entity complained of low morale and victimisation. The Committee will interact with the council and executive management to ascertain if things have improved at the entity. The Committee today visited the Media Development and Diversity Agency (MDDA) which has also over the recent past experienced various governance and leadership challenges. Details of the Visit Venue: Eco Glade 2, 420 Witch Hazel Street, Eco Park, Centurion
