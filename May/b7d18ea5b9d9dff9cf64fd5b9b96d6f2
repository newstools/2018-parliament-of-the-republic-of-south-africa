Parliament, Tuesday, 15 May 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries today received a briefing from the Forestry Sector Charter Council and the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on the submissions received from forestry workers at the National Forests Amendment Bill public hearings, which were held in provinces with a large forestry sector. The complaints heard during the submissions concerned the non-involvement of communities in forestry issues; limited or non-dissemination of information to communities; the isolation of communities by industry; the lack of measures to enforce compliance with broad-based black economic empowerment; poor ownership, management control and skills development; lack of participation by women; and adverse living conditions for employees including low wages, unfair treatment, dilapidated dwellings, evictions and security of tenure issues. The committee received the report on work in progress. The Forestry Sector Charter Council is encouraged to complete the investigations and report back to the committee. The committee welcomes the Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme, which will provide support to small producers on forestry. The committee today continued with deliberations and amendments to the National Forests Amendment Bill [B11-2016].
