Parliament, Wednesday, 30 May 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs has today resolved to make a final decision on the need to undertake phase 2 (A full inquiry) into the process undertaken by the Department of Home Affairs in the naturalisation of the Gupta Family later in the year. The committee had expected to make a decision today, but was informed that the Parliamentary Legal Services needed more time to gather further information that will guide the decision to hold the inquiry. “In principle, the decision to hold a full inquiry still holds, what the committee is awaiting is comprehensive information on the matter. The information required is with the Department of Home Affairs and dates back to the initial application in 1995. The report will also include recommendation on the format that the inquiry must take. We will receive this report during the next session of Parliament, which is scheduled for August 2018,” said Mr Hlomani Chauke, the Chairperson of the Committee. The gathering of information will also include verification of Corporate Social responsibility initiatives that the family provided to support their application for early naturalisation under exceptional circumstances. The committee remains committed to dealing with the matter and laying bare all processes that were undertaken to ensure that all procedures within the department were followed.
