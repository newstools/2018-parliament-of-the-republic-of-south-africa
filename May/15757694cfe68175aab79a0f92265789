Parliament, Tuesday 8 May 2018 – Budget Vote Debates, starting at Parliament tomorrow, provide another opportunity for Parliament and the people to interact with the budget. Research has shown that meaningful public participation and parliamentary oversight over budget processes increases social ownership of the budget and effective allocation of funds, while reducing waste. The Budget Vote Debates – 11 scheduled for this week – take place in mini-plenary sittings of the National Assembly. Rules about filming and photographing at full plenary sittings apply also to these mini-plenaries. Parliament covers the proceedings and provides broadcast feeds to media. Media wishing to photograph during mini-plenary sittings or to receive a live feed should send their details a day beforehand to the officials listed below. Details needed are: full name, ID or passport number, name of media organisation and contact details. Mlindi Mpindi: mmpindi@parliament.gov.za (081 716 7329 or 021 403 2340)
