Parliament, Tuesday, 3 April 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources has extended heartfelt condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of the six deceased mine workers, who died when the bus they were driving in was set alight in Driekop, Limpopo. The committee also wishes a speedy recovery to 28 others, including the bus driver, who were injured in the same fire. The committee understands that they sustained injuries as they escaped. “The people who set the bus alight are heartless criminals who should be arrested immediately and face the full might of the law. The law enforcement agencies should not rest until such evil elements are removed from society completely,” said Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, the Chairperson of the committee.
