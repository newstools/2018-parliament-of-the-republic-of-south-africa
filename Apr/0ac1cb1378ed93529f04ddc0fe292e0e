Parliament, Monday, 02 April 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Health Ms Mary-Ann Dunjwa refutes the claim in the article carried by yesterday’s City Press (01 April 2018) that she received a letter from a concerned group of medical professionals raising concerns about victimisation of black candidates wanting to specialise in obstetrics and gynaecology and black examiners. According to the article a concerned group of professionals is calling on Parliament to intervene on a matter of the removal of a black medical professor from examiners panel on allegations of leaking final questions in a gynaecology module exam. “I never received a letter from a group of concerned medical professionals, furthermore no individual medical professional talked to me on behalf of a collective of medical professionals on the allegations mentioned in the article” emphasised Ms Dunjwa. Ms Dunjwa also find it shocking to see her name and her photograph in a newspaper without her side of the story to establish the authenticity of the claim that she received a letter before the article could be published. “I find this as a shoddy and unethical journalism. I deserved to be consulted before this claim could be published carrying my name and identity” said Ms Dunjwa ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, MS MARY-ANN DUNJWA.
