The Portfolio Committee on Labour has reopened the opportunity to make oral submissions on the National Minimum Wage Bill and related pieces of legislations. The Acting Chairperson of the Committee, Ms Sharome van Schalkwyk, said it was crucial for the committee to hear the presentations from stakeholders today. “The committee received requests during recess for oral submissions from the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) and other organisations that are here, but also written submissions were received. Although the committee had passed the stage of oral submissions, it is critical that the committee makes the process as inclusive as possible,” Ms Van Schalkwyk said. Saftu’s input is important, particularly as it is not represented on the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac). “It is important to hear their side as we conclude the national minimum wage,” she said. “We made this exception based on the reasons mentioned and in the interest of public participation into legislation-making process,” Ms Van Schalkwyk explained. Saftu and other organisations such as the National Employers’ Association of South Africa, Business Unity South Africa and AgriSA will be allowed an opportunity to give their inputs. The committee was scheduled to start the clause-by-clause consideration of the Bill today, but agreed that it is important that the process is as inclusive as possible. Committee member Mr Lemias Mashile commented: “We should not have organisations that feel excluded.” Committee Member Mr Michael Bagraim said he was happy that Saftu, the second biggest trade union federation in the country, will make a presentation. “They are a loud voice and their voice must be heard,” he said. The Saftu delegation is led by its General-Secretary, Mr Zwelinzima Vavi. Sibongile Maputi
