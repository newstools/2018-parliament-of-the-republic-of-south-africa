Parliament: Sunday, 15 April 2018 – Parliament’s programme this term, which begins this week, is packed with plenaries, questions to the Executive, budget votes, the National Council of Provinces’ (NCOP) local government week and youth parliament, amongst others. The NCOP will kick start its programme this week on Tuesday, 17 April, with a focus on Questions to the Social Services cluster ministers (Arts & Culture, Basic Education, Higher Education & Training and Sports & Recreation). On Wednesday, the House will hold a debate on the outcomes of the Report-Back Session: Taking Parliament to the People in Eastern Cape which was held in March. The rest of the Social Services Cluster ministries (Health, Human Settlements, Social Development and Water & Sanitation) will appear in the House for questions on Thursday. The National Assembly (NA), on the other hand, will hold its first plenary sitting on Tuesday, 24 April, where reports of Committees, motions without notice, Members’ statements and notices of motion will be discussed. Deputy President Mr David Mabuza will return to the House during the same week to make oral replies to questions. The Joint Constitutional Review Committee has called for written public submissions on the review of Section 25 of the Constitution and other sections where necessary, to make it possible for the state to expropriate land in the public interest without compensation. As part of its constitutional obligation to facilitate public participation, the Committee has opened a process for written submissions from all stakeholders to submit proposals on the necessary changes to the laws and mechanisms to enable land expropriation without compensation. In May, the NCOP will hold a three-day (08 – 10 May) Local Government Week (LGW) whose aim, amongst others, is to ensure that the three spheres of government plan together and operate in harmony. The LGW is one way of bringing the three spheres together in order to debate matters relating to local sphere of government and to seek solutions to challenges affecting the local sphere within the context of co-operative government and inter-governmental relations. The NCOP is the only institution in South Africa’s constitutional construct that brings together the representatives of the three spheres under one roof. It plays a crucial role in overseeing the adherence to the principles of co-operative government and intergovernmental relations as outlined in Chapter 3 of the Constitution. The event is hosted jointly with the South African Local Government Association. Representatives from national government, provincial legislatures, civil society and various other key stakeholders are expected to participate in the session. The National Assembly will also begin its mini-plenary sessions to deliberate on the budget votes on Wednesday, 09 May. In June, the legislative sector will again host the Youth Parliament in order to provide a public platform for young people from across the country to ventilate on various issues affecting and help the legislators with ideas on how to address those. The dates and venues for this year’s event will be announced in due course.
