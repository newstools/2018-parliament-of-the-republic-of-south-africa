The preparations for the funeral of Ms Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, are at an advanced stage and almost complete, Spokesperson for the Johannesburg Metro Mr Wayne Minaar has said. Ms Madikizela-Mandela was a Member of Parliament at the time of her death, on the Easter Monday. Mr Minaar said all roads leading to the Orlando Stadium, where the funeral service will be hosted, will be closed at Midday. “From the traffic and security services we are ready for both the funeral service, and the procession to Fourways cemetery park where Ms Madikizela will be laid to rest,” Mr Minaar said. At the stadium and around the stadium security forces were doing their dry runs and last moment preparations. The media also was taken around the venue and the details of how the funeral will unfold. Mr Minaar said they had been made aware of a possible protest intended to disturb the procession, but that is under control. Ms Madikizela-Mandela’s body will be taken to her house for the last time, from the Kopane Funeral Parlour, and will move along the Sofasonke Street where thousands of Soweto residents are expected to form the guard of honour. “We are ready, we will deal with any disturbance decisively,” Mr Minaar said. The funeral is happening tomorrow, and is expected to be attended by dignitaries, ambassadors and heads of state, from all over the world. The Zulu Kingdom has already provided four cows to the family for the funeral. By Sibongile Maputi
