Parliament, Friday, 6 April 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs welcomes the signing of contracts with 27 independent power producers by the Minister of Energy, Mr Jeff Radebe. These contracts are worth R55.92 billion. This truly indicates South Africa’s commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions footprint, and hence transition to a low-carbon economy, as articulated in the country’s development blueprint, the National Development Plan. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy presents a significant opportunity in that the commercialisation of low-carbon solutions, including clean energy technologies, can further catalyse an important emerging market and support the transformation of our energy sector. The Chairperson of the Committee, Mr Philemon Mapulane, says: “This signing is also important in terms of the Paris Agreement, which we had both signed and ratified as a country. The Paris Agreement represents the first comprehensive climate change agreement in the world, designed to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. “What we are seeing here is a deliberate move by our country from intensive consumption of hydrocarbons to clean renewables that do not harm the environment and health or well-being of our people as set out in the Constitution of the Republic. We have certainly set the stage for an increase in renewable investments in our country, which could accelerate the decline of traditional energy and accelerate the adoption of alternative energies.” ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS, MR PHILEMON MAPULANE.
