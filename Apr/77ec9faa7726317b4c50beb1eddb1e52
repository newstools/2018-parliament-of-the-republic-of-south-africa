Parliament, Monday, 23 April 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Sport and Recreation has expressed its horror at the violence that unfolded at the Moses Mabhida stadium on Saturday, 21 April 2018. Sport has a history of bringing together people of different communities and cultural backgrounds, but the behaviour displayed by fans during local soccer events especially, has been appalling and unacceptable said the committee. Chairperson of the committee Ms Beauty Dlulane, said: “This type of behaviour will not be tolerated. Those who inflicted such violence and chaos must be brought to justice and banned from attending future sporting events.” The committee notes the serious injuries sustained by a male security guard, as confirmed by the stadium’s operational manager, Mr Lunga Lamula. The committee wishes all those injured during these unruly and unjustified attacks a speedy recovery.
