Parliament, Sunday, 29 April 2018 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Arts and Culture, Ms Xoliswa Tom has expressed a heartfelt word of condolence on behalf of the committee to the bereaved families of the three “lodestars” and rising stars, who died tragically in a car accident yesterday (28 Saturday 2018) on N6 national road between Jamestown and Queenstown in the Eastern Cape. "It is with deep sorrow and profound grief that the committee has learnt of the tragic death of the three media personalities, the rising stars who were a gift, not just to their families, but to the entire South African nation. They were the rising future stars and the shining role models to aspiring young people in the field of arts and creative industries”, said Ms Tom. The three local “lodestars” are Akhumzi Jezile, Thobani Mseleni and Siyasanga Kobese. The committee joins the nation in mourning the death of these three rising stars. “The rich legacy they leave behind will certainly live on and keep them always alive among South Africans” said Ms Tom.
