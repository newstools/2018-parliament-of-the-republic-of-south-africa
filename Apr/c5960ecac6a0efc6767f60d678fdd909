Parliament, Friday 6 April 2018 – The Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians (CWP) Africa Region is deeply saddened by news of the death of the Right Honourable Umar Buba Jibril, the Deputy Leader of the House of Representatives in the National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Executive Committee Member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) Africa Region. The Right Honourable Jibril’s participation in the work of the CPA contributed to its growth, including ongoing discussion about reforming the 180-member body - now in its 107th year - into a more effective multilateral organisation. He was passionate also about empowerment of women and the CWP’s drive to increase women's representation in legislatures. His efforts and those of his colleagues, who lobbied and canvassed, were key in the election of the Honourable Emilia Monjowa Lifaka as Vice Chairperson of the CPA Executive Committee in December 2016. At the 63rd CPA General Assembly in 2017, she was elected Chairperson of the CPA International Executive Committee. Honourable Lifaka, also the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Cameroon since 2009, has been active in the CPA for many years. The Right Honourable Jibril ensured that the concerns of the people of Lokoja/Kogi federal constituency were raised in Nigeria’s National Assembly. Through his engagement with other parliamentarians from other countries, he shared ideas that will enhance the work of parliaments globally. As the CWP Africa Region, we extend our sincere condolences to the family, friends, political party and the Parliament of Nigeria. ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
