Parliament, Tuesday, 10 April 2018 – The Portfolio Committee on Sport and Recreation congratulates Caster Semenya for breaking the 1500m record, an event she has just started participating in. The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane said a double is possible and is there for South Africa’s golden girl to take. “The committee is extremely proud of the achievements on the field in the 2018 edition of the Commonwealth games in Australia. “South Africa’s flag is flying up there with other nations,” Ms Dlulane said. “The committee is extremely happy as this is an indication of the work SA has been doing over a number of years in athletics. This performance needs to be repeated and sustained,” she said. Team SA has received 9 gold medals and there is a possibility of receiving more. Ms Dlulane said the double is possible as Caster is yet to race in the 800m. But also the Committee is impressed with the victory of Akani Simbine, and Henricho Bruintjies in the 100m an event, for far too long dominated by Jamaicans. “Our athletes have delivered on what they had promised on, and I will be speaking for every South African when I say the nation is excited.” ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SPORT AND RECREATION, MS BEAUTY DLULANE.
