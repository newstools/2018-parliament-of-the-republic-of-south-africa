The Select Committee on Land and Mineral Resources is working hard to finalise the processing of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Amendment (MPRDA) Bill. The committee sat on Tuesday morning (17 April) to go through the Bill clause by clause and vote on the changes made. The process to finalise the MPRDA Bill comes after the announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa during the State of the Nation Address in which he mentioned that government is determined to work with mining companies, unions and communities to grow the sector. He also said that he is looking forward to enacting the Bill into law in order to entrench existing regulatory certainty within the mining sector. The Deputy Minister of the Department of Mineral Resources, Mr Godfrey Oliphant, raised a concern during the meeting about the slow pace of processing the Bill. “The investment pattern has shifted in the country and mining sector has great potential to grow the economy. The committee should move with speed to finalise the Bill in order to provide regulatory certainty,” said Mr Oliphant. Although committing to fast track the Bill, committee members emphasised the need to do due diligence to allow the Bill to pass constitutional muster. The Bill is before Parliament for the second time after it was returned by former President Jacob Zuma, with some reservations, including that there was insufficient consultation with the National House of Traditional Leaders. The committee undertook to have another full-day meeting to finalise clause-by-clause input into the Bill. Justice Molafo
