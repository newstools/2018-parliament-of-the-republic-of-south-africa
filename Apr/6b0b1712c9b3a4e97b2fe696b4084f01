Parliament, Saturday, 21 April 2018 â€“ Parliament will continue to pursue the disciplinary action against its suspended Secretary, Mr Gengezi Mgidlana, following a Western Cape High Court decision yesterday, Friday, 20 April 2018 to dismiss his attempt to interdict the process. Mr Mgidlana is facing charges that relate to, inter alia, the alleged breach of the Financial Management of Parliament and Provincial Legislatures Act, breach of the parliamentary policies as well as the National Road Traffic Act. His application sought to interdict the disciplinary hearing pending his request to have the report of the Audit Committee reviewed. The date for the formal hearing was set for 9 to 20 April 2018 but Mr Mgidlana filed an urgent application with the court to interdict the process. The interdict application was on Friday dismissed with costs. The disciplinary process commenced on 12 February 2018 but the formal hearing of evidence has not started yet as the Chairperson, Mr Lance Witten of ZS Inc., had to deal with preliminary matters, including points in limine raised by Mr Mgidlana. The latter was dismissed by Mr Witten. ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
